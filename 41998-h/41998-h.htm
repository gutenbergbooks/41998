<h1>POTTERY OF THE ANCIENT PUEBLOS.</h1>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="center">By <span class="smcap">William H. Holmes</span>.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>INTRODUCTORY.</h2>


<p>A study of the pottery of the ancient Pueblo peoples is here commenced
in accordance with plans formed years ago by the Director of
the Bureau of Ethnology. His aim was to present to the world a
monographic work upon the splendid material obtained by the Bureau,
including with it the important collections made previously by himself.
The preparation of this work has been postponed from time to
time with the view of completing the collections, which were being enriched
by annual visits to the Pueblo country. Meantime I began the
study of the collection for the purpose of securing at the start a satisfactory
classification of the material on hand.</p>

<p>The present paper is the first result of that study. I have, however,
taken up only the more ancient groups of ware, leaving the rest for
subsequent papers. A comparative study is not attempted, for the
reason that a detailed examination of all the groups to be considered is
absolutely essential to satisfactory results. Conclusions drawn from
partial observations lead generally to error.</p>

<p>There were great difficulties in the way of treating satisfactorily the
modern varieties of ware, as no one had sufficient familiarity with the
language of the Pueblo tribes to discuss the ideographic phases of the
ornamentation. Mr. F. H. Cushing's studies bid fair to supply this
want, and his recent return from Zuñi has led to the preparation of the
valuable paper presented in this volume.</p>

<p>Mr. James Stevenson, who has procured a large portion of the collection
of modern pottery, has published catalogues with copious illustrations.
Most of the cuts have been prepared under my supervision,
and have been selected with the view of securing engravings of a full
series of typical examples for a final work.

<h2>PUEBLO ART.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Distribution.</span>&mdash;The ancient Pueblo peoples dwelt in a land of cañons
and high plateaus. They had their greatest development in the valley
of the Rio Colorado, where they delighted to haunt the shadows of the
deepest gorges and build their dwellings along the loftiest cliffs. The
limits of their territory are still in a measure undefined. We discover
remnants of their arts in the neighboring valleys of Great Salt Lake,
the Arkansas, and the Rio Grande, and southward we can trace them
beyond the Rio Gila into the table-lands of Chihuahua and Sonora.</p>

<p>Thus outlined, we have an area of more than one hundred thousand
square miles, which has at times more or less remote been occupied by
tribes of town-building and pottery-making Indians.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Character.</span>&mdash;High and desert-like as this land is, it has borne a
noble part in fostering and maturing a culture of its own&mdash;a culture
born of unusual needs, shaped by exceptional environment, and limited
by the capacities of a peculiar people. Cliff houses and cavate dwellings
are not new to architecture, and pottery resembling the Pueblo
ware in many respects may be found wherever man has developed a
corresponding degree of technical skill; yet there is an individuality in
these Pueblo remains that separates them distinctly from all others and
lends a keen pleasure to their investigation.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Treatment.</span>&mdash;The study of prehistoric art leads inevitably to inquiries
into the origin of races. Solutions of these questions have generally
been sought through migrations, and these have been traced in
a great measure by analogies in archæologic remains; but in such investigation
one important factor has been overlooked, namely, the laws
that govern migrations of races do not regulate the distribution of arts.
The pathways do not correspond, but very often conflict. The arts migrate
in ways of their own. They pass from place to place and from
people to people by a process of acculturation, so that peoples of unlike
origin practice like arts, while those of like origin are found practicing
unlike arts. The threads of the story are thus so entangled that we
find it impossible to trace them backward to their beginnings.</p>

<p>For the present, therefore, I do not propose to study the arts of this
province with the expectation that they will furnish a key to the origin
of the peoples, or to the birthplace of their arts, but I shall treat them
with reference rather to their bearing upon the processes by which culture
has been achieved and the stages through which it has passed,
keeping always in mind that a first requisite in this work is a systematic
and detailed study of the material to be employed.

<h2>THE CERAMIC ART.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Age.</span>&mdash;The ceramic art of the ancient Pueblos is practically a unit.
We find in its remains few indications of distinct periods. There is
nothing to carry us back to a remote past. The oldest specimens known
are nearly as high in the scale as the latest. In the deposits of caves
and burial-grounds we find, so far, nothing more archaic than in the
ruins of once populous villages and beneath the fallen walls of hewnstone
cliff houses. In methods of manufacture and in styles of ornamentation
there is no specific distinction.</p>

<p>Once introduced, there is much in the character of the country to develop
this art. The people were sedentary, and thus able to practice
the art continuously for a long period; and in a country so arid there
was often great need of vessels suitable for the transportation and storage
of water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Material.</span>&mdash;Nature was lavish in her supply of the material needed.
Suitable clay could be found in nearly every valley, both in the well-exposed
strata and in the sediment of streams. I have noticed that
after the passage of a sudden storm over the mesa country, and the
rapid disappearance of the transient flood, the pools of the arroyos
would retain a sediment of clay two or three inches thick, having a
consistency perfectly suited to the hand of the potter. This I have
taken without tempering and have made imitations of the handsome
vases whose remnants I could pick up on all sides. In drying and
burning, these vessels were liable to crack and fall to pieces; but I see
no reason why, with the use of proper tempering materials, this natural
paste might not be successfully employed. It would not be difficult,
however, to find the native clay among the sedimentary formations of
this district. Usually the clay has been very fine grained, and when
used without coarse tempering the vessels have an extremely even and
often a conchoidal fracture.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tempering.</span>&mdash;The materials used in tempering do not often come into
notice. It appears that, in a majority of cases, fine sand, probably derived
from naturally disintegrated rocks, was employed. A large percentage
of rather coarse sand is found in the more roughly finished
coil-made ware, but vessels intended for smooth finish have little perceptible
tempering material.</p>

<p>The speckled appearance of some of the abraded surfaces suggests
the use of pulverized potsherds, a practice frequently resorted to by
the modern tribes. In some localities, notably in the south, we find a
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
slight admixture of mica, which may have come from the use of pulverized
micaceous rock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Construction.</span>&mdash;No one can say just how the materials were manipulated,
fashioned into vessels, and baked; yet many facts can be gleaned
from a critical examination of the vessels themselves; and an approximate
idea of the various processes employed may be formed by a study
of the methods of modern potters of the same region or of corresponding
grades of culture.</p>

<p>It is evident that the vessels were built and finished by the hands
alone; no wheel was used, although supports, such as shallow earthen
vessels, baskets, and gourds were certainly employed to a considerable
extent. Primitive processes of building have varied considerably. The
simplest method perhaps was that of shaping a single mass of clay by
pressure with the fingers, either with or without the assistance of a mold
or support. The mold would be useful in shaping shallow vessels, such
as plates, cups, and bowls. The walls of vessels of eccentric forms or
having constricted apertures would be carried upward by the addition
of small more or less elongated masses of clay, with no support but the
hand or an implement held in the hand. Casting proper, in regularly
constructed molds, was practiced only by the more cultured races, such
as the Peruvians. A variety of methods may have been employed in
the construction of a single piece.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Surface Finish.</span>&mdash;A great deal of attention was given to surface
finish. In the coiled ware the imbricate edges of the fillets were generally
either smoothed down and obliterated entirely, or treated in such a way
as to give a variety of pleasing effects of relief decoration. Vessels
with smooth surfaces, whether built by coiling, modeling, or molding,
very often received a thin coat of fine liquid clay, probably after partial
drying and polishing. This took the place of the enamels used by
more accomplished potters, and being usually white, it gave a beautiful
surface upon which to execute designs in color. Before the color was
applied the surface received a considerable degree of polish by rubbing
with a suitable implement of stone or other material. Attention was
given chiefly to surfaces exposed to view&mdash;the interior of bowls and the
exterior of narrow-necked vases.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Firing.</span>&mdash;The firing of the ancient ware seems to have been carefully
and successfully accomplished. The methods probably did not differ
greatly from those practiced by the modern Pueblo tribes. The ware
is, as a rule, light in color, but is generally much clouded by the dark
spots that result from imperfections in the methods of applying the fire.
The heat was rarely great enough to produce anything like vitrifaction
of the surface, and the paste is seldom as hard as our stone ware.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Glaze.</span>&mdash;A great deal has been said about the glaze of native American
wares, which exists, if at all, through accident. The surface of the
white ware of nearly all sections received a high degree of mechanical
polish, and the effect of firing was often to heighten this and give
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269">269</a></span>
at times a slightly translucent effect; a result of the spreading or sinking
of the coloring matter of the designs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hardness.</span>&mdash;The paste exposed in fractured edges can be scratched
with a steel point, and often with ease. Some of the white pottery of
ancient Tusayan can be carved almost as readily as chalk or sun-dried
clay. At the same time all localities furnish occasionally specimens
that through the accidents of firing have the ring and hardness of
stoneware. The ancient pottery is generally superior in hardness to
that produced by the historic tribes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color.</span>&mdash;This pottery presents a pleasing variety of color, although
the light grays prevail, especially in the more archaic varieties. The
general color probably depended greatly upon the natural constituents
of the clay and the degree of heat applied, and these conditions varied
with the locality and the people. Reds and browns result from the
presence of iron, which may have been oxidized in burning, or the red
oxides may have been used in rare cases as coloring matter in kneading
the clay. The surface is often lighter than the mass; a condition probably
resulting from the presence of vegetable matter in the clay, which
is destroyed on the surface and remains unchanged within. In the
south the colors of the paste are often slightly reddish or yellowish in
hue. It is notable that a small percentage of the ware of all localities
is red. This gives rise to the suggestion that vessels of this color probably
had some especial or sacred use. Color is known to have an intimate
connection with superstitious observances among many barbarian
peoples.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span>&mdash;In form the ancient ware is universally simple and pleasing.
Many shapes known to both civilized and barbarian art are absent.
High-necked bottles and shallow plates are of rare occurrence, and
pitchers, canteens or lenticular bottles, and vessels with legs and stands
are unknown. There is a notable dearth of life forms, a circumstance
that would seem to indicate the rather tardy development of a taste for
modeling&mdash;a condition which may have resulted from the comparatively
recent origin or introduction of art in clay.</p>

<p>Vessels with full globular bodies prevail. The bottoms are generally
round or a little pointed, indicating primitive conditions of life and suggesting
great simplicity in methods of manufacture and in the models
copied.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Forms.</i>&mdash;There can be no doubt that ceramic forms are
to a great extent derivative, and the search for their originals will
constitute a most important feature in our studies. Turning to nature
for possible originals, we find them liberally supplied by both the animal
and the vegetable kingdom. The shells of the sea shore were probably
among the first receptacles for food and drink. We have examples of
pottery from the mounds in the Mississippi Valley, representing three
or four distinct varieties of shells. The shells of turtles and the horns
of cattle and other animals have also served as models.

<p>The vegetable world furnishes many originals; the gourd, for example,
was utilized at a very early date. Its forms are greatly varied, and
must have given rise to many primitive shapes of vessels in clay, and
perhaps in wicker-work and wood. One of the ordinary forms cut off
midway would suggest the series of bowls outlined in Fig. 210. Simply
perforated it would give rise to the series illustrated in Fig. 211.</p>

<p>Wide-mouthed vases would be suggested as indicated in Fig. 212,
bottles as shown in Fig. 213, and eccentric forms as seen in Fig. 214.</p>

<p>These particular examples are presented in illustration of the manner
in which forms may be derived and nothing more, as there are many
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
possible origins of the same forms. In a separate paper I have amplified
this topic, and have discussed the relative importance of the influence of
natural and artificial products upon the conformation of utensils of clay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handles.</span>&mdash;In searching for the first suggestions of handles we must
certainly go back to the very beginnings of art, when men and women
employed leaves or vines to carry their children or their food, or to suspend
them for safety from the trees of the forest. The art of basketry
would naturally fall heir to this use of handles. Clay, bronze, and iron,
when they came into use, would also inherit some of the forms thus developed.
There are, however, other sources of equal importance, among
which are animal forms, such as horns, and various forms of vegetable
growth, such as the gourd. The latter may again serve as an illustration.</p>

<p>By cutting the body of the gourd longitudinally at one side of the axis,
we have dippers with straight or curved necks or handles. The primitive
potter would in like manner have the suggestion of a handled vessel
in clay, which, carried forward by the ever active spirit of improvement,
would in time give us the series shown in Figs. 215 and 216:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 216</span>.&mdash;Origin and development of handles.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ornament.</span>&mdash;The shapes of vessels are, in a measure, ornamental, but
it is difficult to say just how much the necessary or functional characters
of particular forms have given way to decorative modifications. Pure
ornament is a feature not essential to the vessel. Its ideas may be expressed
by three principal methods: by relieved, by flat, and by intaglio
figures.</p>

<p>Relief ornament was not extensively employed by the ancient Pueblos.
The forms are few and simple, and nearly all are traceable to constructional
or to functional features. Thus the ornamental crenulated surface
of the coiled ware is constructional, consisting as it does of ridges,
resulting from the method of building. The knobs, isolated coils, and
festooned fillets are probably, in some cases, atrophied forms of handles.</p>

<p>Intaglio decoration is still more rare. It consists of incised, impressed,
and punctured figures. No designs of importance are produced by this
method, the most notable being the simple patterns traced by the
finger or a sharp implement upon the relieved edges of fillets in the
coiled ware.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span></p>

<p>With these people, the highest class of decoration consisted of designs
in color. This topic is fully discussed in a subsequent section.</p>

<p><i>Origin of ornament.</i>&mdash;It is probable that before pottery came into use
the decorative art had been cultivated in other fields, and we shall need
to look both to nature and to antecedent arts for the originals of many
decorative ideas.</p>

<p>From a remote period man has been able to appreciate beauty. The
first exercise of taste would probably be in the direction of personal
adornment, and would consist in the choice of colors or articles thought
to enhance attractiveness, or in the grouping and modification of objects
at first functional in character. Later, taste would be exercised on a
variety of subjects, and finally it would extend to all things in use. Man
may have recognized the comeliness of the first simple articles employed
in his humble arts, but when he came to attempt the multiplication
of these articles artificially, utility was probably the only thought.
In reproducing them, however, non-essential features would be copied
automatically, and the work of art would through this accident inherit
purely ornamental attributes.</p>

<p>Thus it appears that the first ideas of decoration do not necessarily
originate in the mind of the potter, but that, like the shapes of art products,
they may be derived, unconsciously, from nature. This is an
important consideration. At a later stage new forms of ornament are
derived in a like manner from constructional features of the various
arts. Invention of decorative motives is not to be expected of a primitive,
tradition-following people. Advance is greatly by utilization of
accidents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use.</span>&mdash;A satisfactory classification of this pottery by functional characters
will be most difficult to make. In the early stages of its manufacture
it was confined chiefly, if not solely, to the alimentary arts. A
differentiation of use would take place when certain vessels were set
aside for special departments of the domestic work. Thus we would
have vessels for eating, for cooking, for carrying, and for storage. When
vessels came to be used in superstitious exercises, certain forms were
probably set aside for especial ceremonies. With some peoples, particular
forms were dedicated to mortuary uses, but we have no clew to any
such custom among the ancient Pueblos, as the same vessel served for
food both before and after death, and cinerary vessels were not called
for. Certain classes of the ruder and plainer ware are found to be blackened
by smoke. These were evidently cooking vessels. The painted
pottery rarely shows evidences of such use. Bowls were probably employed
chiefly in preparing and serving food. The larger vessels were
devoted to carrying and storing water, fruits, grains, and miscellaneous
articles. Smaller vessels were used as receptacles for paint, grease, and
the like. The ancient people had not yet devoted their ceramic art to
trivial uses&mdash;there are no toys, no rattles, and no grotesque figures.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification.</span>&mdash;In treating a subject covering so wide a field, and
embracing such a diversity of products, a careful classification of the material
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
is called for. Three grand divisions of the ceramic work of this
province may be made on a time basis, namely: prehistoric, transitional,
and modern. At present I have to deal chiefly with the prehistoric, but
must also pay some attention to the transitional, as it embraces many
features common both to the archaic and to the modern art. In discussing
the prehistoric pottery I find it convenient to consider it under
the three heads, coiled ware, plain ware, and painted ware. This classification
is unsatisfactory, as it is based upon somewhat imperfectly
differentiated characters. The smooth vessel is in many cases a coil-built
one with obliterated coils, and a painted vessel a smooth one with
the addition of designs in color. Very little of the pottery was left
plain, but the coiled and painted varieties are fully represented in every
locality.</p>

<p>I place the coiled ware first because to all appearances it is the most
archaic variety and one which is rarely made at the present day. I
suspect that the pieces made by modern potters serve to supply the wants
of the collectors rather than to meet the requirements of traditional
art. Among the collections in the National Museum are found many
crude attempts to manufacture this ware by potters who did not comprehend
the secrets of its construction, or who thought to produce the
coiled effect by the cheap device of scarifying and indenting the surface
of a plain vessel.</p>

<p>Close relations are established between the coiled and the painted
pottery, not only by the identity of materials, form, color, and time, but
by the union of the two methods of finishing, the coiling and painting,
in one and the same vessel, as may be seen in the examples given in
in the following pages.</p>

<h3>COIL-MADE WARE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Coiling.</span>&mdash;The art of building vessels by means of coils of clay has
been practiced by many widely separated communities, and is, therefore,
certainly not peculiar to the ancient Pueblos. A careful study of
the ceramic field shows considerable diversity in the treatment of the
coil. The most striking variation, the employment of the coil as a
means of embellishment, is, so far as my observation extends, peculiar to
the Pueblo peoples. With others it is a feature of construction simply.</p>

<p>The preliminary steps are with all primitive potters in a general
sense the same. The first care is to secure suitable clay and to have it
properly purified and tempered. After this the treatment varies greatly.</p>

<p><i>Coiling of the Pueblos.</i>&mdash;The ancient Pueblo potter rolled out long,
slender fillets or ropes of clay, varying in width and thickness to suit
the size and character of the vessel to be constructed. They were usually
perhaps from one-fourth to one-half of an inch in thickness. When they
were properly trimmed and smoothed the potter began by taking the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
end of a single strip between his fingers and proceeded to coil it upon
itself, gradually forming a disk, as shown in Fig. 217, which represents
the base of a large vase from the San Juan Valley.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">
<a href="images/274_dp501a.jpg"  id="p274_f217" >

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 218</span>.&mdash;Section of coil-made vessel.</p>
</div>

<p>At first the fillets overlapped only a little, but as the disk grew large
and was rounded upward to form the body of the vessel, the imbrication
became more pronounced. The fillet was placed obliquely, as shown
in the section, Fig. 218, and was exposed on the exterior side to probably
one-half of its width. Strip after strip of clay was added, the ends
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
being carefully joined, so that the continuity might not be broken until
the vessel was completed. The rim generally consisted of a broad strip,
thickened a little at the lip, and somewhat recurved. The exterior imbricate
edges were carefully preserved, while those on the inner surface
were totally obliterated, first by pressure, and finally by smoothing
down with an implement, or with the fingers, imprints of the latter being
frequently visible. So thoroughly were the fillets pressed down and
welded together that the vessels seldom fracture more readily along
the lines of junction than in other directions.</p>

<p>The fact that the spiral ridges of the bottom are frequently without
abrasion, as shown in Fig. 217, suggests an idea in regard to the manipulation
of the coil. While building the upper part of the vase the base
would necessarily rest upon some sort of support and the soft ridges
would suffer from abrasion. In preventing such defacement, an interior
support, such as a mold or the base of another vessel, must have been
used, in which case the vessel was necessarily built in an inverted position.
At the same time it is clear that this would be practicable only
with bowls or with very wide-mouthed vessels, as the mold, if rigid,
could not be removed through a restricted aperture.</p>

<p>In pressing the coil down, in welding it to the preceding turn, internal
support would be necessary, as otherwise the strain would warp the
walls. A curved trowel or a rounded pebble could be used as long as the
aperture would admit the hand, but no support excepting the fingers,
or an implement shaped for the purpose, could be used beyond this
stage. The whole process was a most delicate one, requiring patience
and skill. In this respect it contrasted strongly with the coiling of other
peoples. As indicated by numerous specimens, the coil was sometimes
laid on the inside of a shallow basket or bowl, the surface of the vessel
showing a combination of basket-markings and nearly obliterated spiral
creases. This device served a good purpose in starting the vessel, the
upper part being completed by free-hand coiling.</p>

<p><i>Coiling of other peoples.</i>&mdash;The art, as practiced by the Indians of
Louisiana, is graphically described by Dumont. The following paragraph
is translated from his work:</p>

<p>"Moreover, the industry of these (savage) girls and women is admirable.
I have already alluded to the skill with which, with their fingers
only, and without a wheel, they make large pieces of pottery. The following
is their method of work: After having collected a quantity of
the proper kind of earth, and having cleaned it thoroughly, they take
shells which they break up and reduce to a very fine, loose powder;
they mix this fine dust with the earth which they have collected, and,
moistening the whole with a little water, work it with their hands and
feet into a paste, from which they make rolls six or seven feet long and
as thick as they may desire. If they wish to make a dish or a vase,
they take one of these rolls by the end, and marking on this lump with
the thumb of the left hand the center of the vessel, they turn the roll
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
around this center with admirable rapidity and dexterity, describing a
spiral. From time to time they dip their fingers into the water, which
they are always careful to have near them, and, with the right hand,
they flatten the inside and the outside of the vase, which without this
would be uneven. In this way they make all kinds of earthen utensils,
dishes, plates, bowls, pots, and jugs, some of which hold as much as 40
or even 50 pints. This pottery does not require much preparation for
baking. After having dried it in the shade, they make a large fire, and
as soon as they think they have enough embers they clean a place in
the middle, and, arranging the pieces of pottery, cover them with charcoal.
It is thus that the pieces are given the necessary heating (cooking),
after which they are as strong as our pottery. There is no doubt
but that we must attribute their strength to the mixture which these
women make of powdered shells with the earth which they employ."<a id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>Professor C. F. Hartt has furnished many facts in regard to the manufacture
of pottery by the Brazilian Indians. According to his account
the women of Santarem model the bottom of a vessel from a lump of clay
in the usual way. Then "a piece of clay is rolled under the hand into
a long, rope-like cylinder. This rope is then coiled around the edge of
the bottom of the vessel, being flattened sidewise by pinching with the
fingers of the left hand, and caused to adhere to the bottom. On this,
coil after coil is laid in like manner, each being flattened as before.
After a few have been added they are worked into shape with the fingers,
which are occasionally moistened in water, and the irregularities produced
by the coils are caused to disappear. The vessel is formed by
the hand alone and the surface is smoothed down by means of a bit of
gourd or a shell, which is from time to time dipped in water. If the
vessel be large it is now set away in the shade for a while to dry a little,
after which new coils are added as above, no other instrument being
used except the hands and the gourd or shell, with which alone the vessel
may receive not only an extremely regular form, but also a very
smooth surface. * * * The coils are so worked together that from
a simple inspection of the vessel it is impossible to determine how it
was built up. I should never have suspected that the pottery of Pacoval
had been made by coiling, were it not that I found the coils still ununited
on the inner surface of the heads of idols."<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>Prof. Hartt states, also, on the authority of Dr. de Magalhaes, that
the pottery of the several tribes of the Araquaya River is always made
by coiling, the surface being worked down by the hand and water and
the aid of a spoon-like trowel made of bamboo. Humboldt makes a
similar statement in regard to the tribes of the Orinoco.</p>

<p>Mr. E. A. Barber<a id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> relates, on the authority of Captain John Moss, a
resident, for a long time, of southwestern Colorado, that the Ute Indians
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277">277</a></span>
manufacture pottery at the present time, and that they probably
follow the methods of the Mokis, from whom they learned the art.</p>

<p>Captain Moss states that "They use marl, which they grind between
two rocks to a very fine powder. They then mix this with water and
knead it as we would dough. Afterwards they roll it out into a rope-like
state about one inch in diameter and several yards in length. They
then commence at the bottom of the jar, or whatever vessel they may
be making, and coil the clay-rope layer on layer until they have the
bottom and three inches of the sides laid up. The tools for smoothing
and joining the layers together are a paddle made out of wood and perfectly
smooth, and an oval-shaped polished stone." Both of these tools
are dipped in the water (salt water is preferred), the stone is held in the
left hand and on the inside of the vessel, and the paddle is applied vigorously
until the surfaces are smooth. The method thus described by
these authors was, probably, almost universally practiced.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 219</span>.&mdash;Ordinary superposition of coils. <span class="author">Section.</span></p>
</div>

<p>I have specimens from a number of the Eastern and Southern States
that fracture along the line of junction, showing clearly the width of
the fillets and the manner of their attachment. I picked up a small
specimen at Avoca, North Carolina, which has broken along the line of
junction, giving the section illustrated in Fig. 219. It will be seen that
there is no overlapping as in the Pueblo work, the attachment being
accomplished by pressure and by drawing both edges of the coil down
over the convex edge of the preceding coil. I have similar specimens
from the modern Pueblos, from Florida, from Mexico, and from Brazil.
It will readily be seen that this method of building differs essentially
from that practiced so successfully by the ancient Pueblos.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Origin of the Coil.</span>&mdash;This use of the coil is but a refinement of the
most simple possible method of construction, that of building by the
addition of small masses of clay. A disk or shallow cup can be formed
successfully by the fingers alone from a single lump of clay, but to
carry the wall upward by pressure or by blows from a paddle would
result in a weak, frayed edge. To counteract or prevent this tendency
small elongated masses are used, which are laid one upon another along
the growing margin. From this, in the most natural manner possible,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
we arrive at the use of the long, even rope or fillet. The imbrication or
overlapping of the coil practiced by the Pueblos may have originated
in the effort to secure a more stable union of the parts which had to be
welded together by pressure. It would also almost necessarily arise
from the attempt to lay the coil upon or within a mold or support. There
is a possibility that it may have been suggested by features of construction
observed in other arts&mdash;the overlapping parts of a roof, of a plate
or scale garment, or of a coiled basket. The latter is especially suggestive,
since we must generally look for the origin of features of the
ceramic art in the features of closely associated arts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Coil in Ornamentation.</span>&mdash;Ordinarily the coil has not been expected
to contribute to the beauty of the vessel, but the Pueblo tribes
made it a prominent feature in decoration. The primitive potter as he
laid his rude coils noticed that the ridges thus produced served to enhance
the appearance of the vessel. He also observed that the series
of indentations left on the outer surface of the fillet in pressing it down
gave a pleasing effect, and made use of the suggestion. Improving
upon the accidents of manufacture, he worked out a variety of decorative
devices.</p>

<p>In some cases the coiled ridges are confined to particular parts of the
vessel, the other parts having been worked down or originally constructed
by plain modeling. Numerous examples have the body quite
plain, the collar alone retaining the spiral ridges of the coil. Fig. 251
illustrates a very good example of this peculiarity.</p>

</div>

<p>The fragment shown in Fig. 220 is from the neck of a pot-shaped
vase. The surface has been plain below and the fillets of the upper part
have been pressed down evenly with the thumb, leaving the extreme
edge of the overlapping band in sharp relief, as shown more clearly in
the section.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<p>The whole coil is sometimes left plain, as in Figs. 221 and 222, in
which cases the edges have been carefully pressed down and smoothed
with the fingers.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 222</span>.&mdash;Rib like coil. <span class="author">Section.</span></p>
</div>

<p>A great variety of devices were resorted to to diversify and decorate
the ribbed spirals, and in this the innate good taste of the Indian exhibits
itself to much advantage. The coil is often indented or crimped
throughout, from the center of the bottom to the rim of the vessel. At
times a few turns at the beginning are left plain, as shown in Fig. 217,
while again alternate bands, consisting of several turns each, are not
crimped, as clearly brought out by an example from Southern Utah,
illustrated in the Art Review for July, 1874, by F. W. Putnam, and also
by two fine specimens recently collected by E. W. Nelson near Springerville,
Arizona.</p>

<p>The decided taste of this ancient people for ornament is still further
indicated by attempts to elaborate more intricate patterns by means of
thumb-nail indentations. The idea may have been borrowed from basketry.
The fragment given in Fig. 223 illustrates the method of procedure.
We have some very fine vessels of this class from Springerville,
and others from the province of Tusayan in which the entire surface
is covered with checkered or meandered patterns. An excellent
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
example is shown in Fig. 253. We shall appreciate the cleverness of
this work more fully when we remember that the separate thumb indentations
forming the figures of the pattern are made in each coil as it is
laid and pressed into place and before the succeeding turn is made.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 224</span>.&mdash;Nail indentions.</p>
</div>

<p>These curious decorative effects were still further elaborated by diversifying
the character of the indentations of the coil. In Fig. 224
we have a most successful effort in this direction. The fillets are alternately
crimped and plain. The thumb, in pressing down the one, has
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
been applied with such force that the nail has cut entirely through it,
indenting the plain layer below and causing the two to coalesce. This
specimen was obtained from the cañon of the Rio Mancos.</p>

<p>Certain districts are particularly rich in remains of this peculiar ware
and furnish many examples of crimped ornament. The remarkable
desert-like plateau lying north of the Grand Cañon of the Colorado contains
many house and village sites. At intervals along the very brink
of the great chasm we come upon heaps of stones and razed walls of
houses about which are countless fragments of this ware. These are
identical in nearly every character with the pottery of Saint George on
the west, of the San Juan on the east, and of the Gila on the south.
A few miles south of Kanab stands a little hill&mdash;an island in the creek
bottom&mdash;which is literally covered with the ruins of an ancient village,
and the great abundance of pottery fragments indicates that it was, for
a long period, the home of cliff-dwelling peoples. In no other case have I
found so complete an assortment of all the varieties of coil-ornamentation.
All the forms already given are represented and a number of
new ones are added.</p>

<hr class="brk" />

<p>One of the most successful of these archaic attempts at relief embellishment
is illustrated in the fragment shown in Fig. 227. The
raised edge of the fillet is pinched out at regular intervals, producing
rows of sharp-pointed "beads." Over the entire surface impressions of
the fine lines of the finger-tips are still distinctly visible. The dotted
lines show the direction of the coil.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span></p>

<p>The indenting was not always done with the thumb or finger-tips, but
a variety of implements were used. The vase, of which Fig. 228 shows
a small fragment, had a figure worked upon it by indenting the soft
coils with a sharp implement.</p>

<hr class="brk" />

<p>In the specimen illustrated in Fig. 230, incised lines are drawn across
the ridges of the coil.</p>

<p>The coil ridges were sometimes worked down into more regular forms
by means of an implement and were left plain or were interrupted by
transverse lines. Lines of nail marking are shown in Fig. 229. These
lines are occasionally combined in rude patterns.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Other varieties of ornament.</span>&mdash;I have already remarked that certain
styles of decoration are confined to somewhat definite geographic
limits. In the ancient Pueblo district
we find that painted designs and coil
ornaments are co-extensive, while
within this area there are but rare
examples of incised designs, stamped
figures, or cord-marking. We find
basket indentations, but these are in
all cases the accidents of manufacture.
The coil has often been laid upon the
inner surface of a basket.</p>

<p>The fragment shown in Fig. 231
was picked up on the site of an ancient
Pueblo village near Abiquiu,
New Mexico. It is a portion of the
neck and upper part of the body of a small vase which was covered
by a simple pattern of intaglio lines, produced with a bone or wooden
stylus.</p>

<p>Ornaments in relief, aside from the coil and forms resulting directly
from its use, were sparingly employed and are of comparatively little
interest. They consist of straight, curved, or crimped fillets, applied
to the surface of the vessel as shown in Fig. 232. Additional examples
are given in Figs. 233, 234, and 235.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span></p>

<p>Nodes, cones, and other forms are also used as seen in Figs. 236, 237,
and 238. These are usually placed about the neck of the vessel, occupying
the places of the handles.</p>

<div class="figright w25">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 232</span>.&mdash;Applied fillet.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Material.</span>&mdash;The clay used in this ware was
in some sections tempered with a large percentage
of rather coarse silicious sand, which
gives to the surface a rough, granular look. In
the south the paste seems to be finer grained
than in the northern districts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color, etc.</span>&mdash;The color of the paste is generally
gray, but in the province of Tusayan it
is frequently yellow. In some cases the surface
has received a wash of fine liquid clay, and
a few bowls from the Little Colorado and Gila
Valleys have designs in white paint covering
the exterior surface. This ware is always well
baked and extremely hard.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Form.</span>&mdash;The forms are not nearly so varied as are those of the painted
ware. The leading variety is a round-bodied, wide-mouthed olla or pot,
with flaring rim. Bottles are of rare occurrence, and bowls are not
nearly so plentiful as in other varieties of pottery. Life and eccentric
forms are occasionally found. Many small vessels of the more elongated
shapes are furnished with handles, which are in most cases
placed vertically upon the neck, and consist of single or double bands
or ropes or of two or more strands twisted together.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Use.</span>&mdash;As a rule the forms are such as have been devoted by most
peoples to culinary uses, and in many cases the entire exterior surface
is coated with soot. Plain vessels of similar outlines are used by the
modern tribes of this province for cooking and serving food. Examples
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
having very neatly or elaborately finished surfaces have apparently
not been used over a fire. Those of large size doubtless served
for the transportation and storage of water.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS OF VESSELS.</h3>

<p>As it is my desire to give this paper something of a monographic
completeness, I shall present a typical series of the best preserved vessels
of this class along with some notices of the circumstances under
which they were discovered. The treatment by districts or localities is
for convenience simply, and has no reference to distinctions in the
character of the ware.</p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE RIO SAN JUAN.</h4>

<p>Our first expeditions into the land of the cliff-dwellers were full of
interest. We were not, however, the first explorers. The miners of
the silver-bearing mountains to the north had made occasional excursions
into the sinuous cañons of the plateau district, and failing to bring
back the coveted gold, told tales of the marvelous cities of the cliffs,
and speculated upon discovering in the débris of ancient temples and
tombs a portion of the fabled gold and jewels of the provinces of Cibola
and Tusayan.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding our entire freedom from expectations in this direction,
the thought gave color to our anticipations, and it was not an uncommon
occurrence to hear, about the slumbering camp fire, half jocular
references to the "great pots of gold moons" that some one had whispered
might be hidden away in the inaccessible cliffs that overshadowed
us.</p>

<p>I shall not soon forget the incidents connected with the discovery of
a pair of fine water-jars&mdash;one of which is illustrated in Fig. 239. On
the occasion of our first passage down the cañon of the Rio Mancos<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> I
made the discovery of a group of fine cliff-houses on the south side,
far up in the vertical walls. On our return I made it a point to camp
for the night directly below these houses, although a dense growth of
underbrush had to be cut away to give room for our beds by the side of
the sluggish stream.</p>

<p>The two finest houses were set in shallow, wind-worn caves, several
hundred feet above the valley. One was almost directly above the
other, the upper being reached by a number of notches picked in the
nearly vertical rock-face.</p>

<p>I had ascended alone and was busily engaged in studying the upper
house and tracing the plans of its fallen walls, when I heard a voice
echoing among the cliffs. Descending hastily to the lower house I found
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
that one of my men had followed me and was excitedly scratching with
a stick among the debris of fallen walls. He had just discovered the
rim of a buried pot, and was fairly breathless from the anticipation of
"piles of moons." By the aid of my geologic hammer we soon had the
upper part of the neck uncovered, but hesitated a moment with bated
breath before venturing to raise the rough stone lid. But there was
no treasure&mdash;only a heap of dust. I was content, however, and when
by a little further search we came upon a second vessel, a mate to the
first, the momentary shades of disappointment vanished.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">

</div>

<p>These vessels had been placed in a small recess, where the falling
walls had not reached them, and were standing just as they had been
left by their ancient possessors. The more perfect one, which had lost
only a small chip from the rim, I determined to bring away entire.
This I succeeded in doing by wrapping it in a blanket, and by means of
straps, slinging it across my back. I carried it thus for a number of
days over the rough trails of the cañons and plateaus. The other,
which was badly cracked when found, was pulled apart and packed
away in one of the mess chests. It is now with its mate in the National
Museum, perfectly restored.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span></p>

<p>The unbroken vessel is shown in Fig. 239 about one-third its real
height. Its capacity is nearly four gallons. The clay is tempered with
a large portion of sand, some grains of which are quite coarse. The
color of the paste is a light gray, apparently not having been greatly
changed by the baking. A few dark contact clouds appear on the sides
of the body. The walls are quite thin for a vessel of its size and are
of very uniform thickness. The entire weight hardly exceeds that of a
common wooden pail of the same capacity. The mouth is wide and the
rim, which is made of a plain rough band, is one inch wide and abruptly
recurved. The vessel can hardly be said to have a neck, as the walls
round gradually outward from the rim to the periphery of the body,
which is full and nearly symmetrical. The narrow strands of clay have
been coiled with something less than average care, the exposed surfaces
being wide in places and in others very narrow. The thumb indentations
have been carelessly made. Two small conical bits of clay are
affixed to the neck as if to represent handles. These may have been
intended for ornaments, but are as likely to owe their presence to some
little superstition of the archaic artisans.</p>

<p>The companion vessel has also a capacity of about four gallons. Its
form differs from that of its mate, being considerably more elongated
above and having a more pronounced neck. The material is about the
same, but the color is darker and the workmanship is superior. The
surface is coated with soot, indicating use over a fire in cooking food or
in boiling water. The coil was laid with a good deal of care and the
indentation was done in a way to produce a series of sharp points along
the margin of the coil. The interior of the rim was finished with a polishing
stone. A small cord of clay was neatly coiled into a double scroll
and attached to the narrowest part of the vessel, corresponding in position
to the knobs in the other example. This ornament, though small,
is nevertheless effective. Similar scrolls are found upon vases from
many parts of the Pueblo Province.</p>

<p>It is an interesting fact that this vessel had been successfully mended
by its owners. A small perforation near the base had been stopped by
cementing a bit of pottery to the inside with clay paste. These
vases were evidently the most important of the household utensils
of the cliff-dwellers, especially as in this place water had to be carried,
at least during a part of the year, from the creek five hundred feet below.
It is probable that baskets and skins were sometimes used for carrying
water, and that the earthen vessels were used as coolers, as are similar
vessels among many primitive peoples. That they were used for carrying
water up the cliffs is indicated by the fragments that lie upon the
slopes and point out the location of houses invisible from the trails below.</p>

<p>A large fragment of a similar olla was picked up in the valley of Epsom
Creek, southeast Utah. This vessel was larger, neater in finish,
and more elegant in shape, than either of those described. A sufficiently
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
large fragment was discovered to show satisfactorily the character
of the rim, the outline of the body, and the details of surface finish.
(Fig. 240.) The rim is but slightly recurved and the neck is high and
upright. The body swelled to a diameter of about eighteen inches at
the greatest circumference. The paste, as usual, indicates a gray clay
tempered with coarse sand. The inside is smooth and the walls are
remarkably thin for so large a vessel, being about one-fourth of an inch
in thickness. The coil is very neatly laid and indented, a variety to
the effect being given by leaving occasional plain bands. This vessel
is described by W. H. Jackson in the Bulletin of the U. S. Geological
Survey of the Territories, Vol. II.</p>

<p>Fragments of this class of ware are found throughout the cañoned
region of southern Utah and for an undetermined distance into Nevada.
I have already described fragmentary specimens from Kanab and therefore
pass on to the west.</p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE RIO VIRGEN.</h4>

<p>The most notable collection of this coiled ware ever yet made in any
one locality is from a dwelling-site tumulus near Saint George, Utah,
nearly three hundred miles west of the Rio Mancos.</p>

<p>About the year 1875, the curator of the National Museum obtained
information of a deposit of ancient relics at the above locality, and in
1876 a collector was sent out to make an investigation. The result, so
far as collections go, was most satisfactory, and the account furnished
gives an insight into the customs of this ancient people not yet obtained
from any other source. On the Santa Clara River, a tributary of the
Rio Virgen, about three miles from the Mormon town of Saint George,
a low mound, which I suppose to have been a sort of village-site tumulus,
was found. The outline was irregular, but had originally been approximately
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288">288</a></span>
circular. It was less than ten feet in height, and covered about
half an acre. One side had been undermined and carried away by the
stream. The work of exhumation was most successfully accomplished
by means of water. A small stream was made to play upon the soft
alluvium, of which the mound was chiefly composed. The sensations
of the collector, as skeleton after skeleton and vase after vase appeared,
must have been highly pleasurable.</p>

<p>It is thought that the inhabitants of this place, like many other primitive
peoples, buried their dead beneath their dwellings, which were
then burned down or otherwise destroyed. As time passed on and the
dead were forgotten, other dwellings were built upon the old sites, until
quite a mound was formed in which all the less perishable remains were
preserved in successive layers.</p>

<p>Following the customs of most primitive peoples, the belongings of
the deceased were buried with them. Earthen vessels were found in
profusion. With a single body, there were sometimes as many as eight
vases, the children having been in this respect more highly favored
than the adults. There seems to have been no system in the arrangement
either of the bodies or of the accompanying relics.</p>

<p>The majority of the vases were either plain or decorated in color, but
many of the larger specimens were of the coiled variety. About sixty
vessels were recovered. Those of the former classes will be described
under their proper headings.</p>

<div class="figcenter w100">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 241</span>.&mdash;Vessel from the tumulus, at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></p>
</div>

<p>The shapes of the corrugated vases are of the simplest kind. The
prevailing form corresponds very closely with the Cliff House specimen
illustrated in Fig. 239. One unusually large example was brought back
in fragments, but has since been successfully restored. It stands
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
nearly seventeen inches high and is sixteen inches in diameter. The
plain part of the rim is one and one-half inches wide, and the lip is well
rounded and strongly recurved. The lines are quite graceful, the neck
expanding below into a globular body which is just a little pointed at
the base. The color is dark, from use over the fire. The fillets of clay
were narrow and very neatly crimped. Roughly estimated, there were
at least three hundred feet of the coil used. The vessel has a capacity
of about ten gallons.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 242</span>.&mdash;Vase from the tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>Vases of this particular outline may be found, varying in size from
these grand proportions to small cups an inch or two in height. Of a
somewhat different type is the vessel shown in Fig. 241. The outline is
symmetrical. The neck is comparatively high and wide and swells out
gently to the widest part of the body, the base being almost hemispherical.
A band about the neck is coiled and roughly indented, while the body is
quite smooth. The plain band about the mouth is broad and sharply
recurved. The coils are wide and deeply indented. They have been
smoothed down somewhat while the clay was still soft. The vase shown
in Fig. 242 is characterized by its upright rim, elongated neck, round
body, and plain broad coils. The fillets are set one upon another, apparently
without the usual imbrication. This latter feature occurs in
a number of cases in the vessels of this locality.</p>

<p>The bottle given in Fig. 243 is quite comely in shape. The neck expands
gracefully from the rim to its junction with the body, which swells
out abruptly to its greatest fullness. The coil is not neatly laid. The
indentation began with the coil, but was almost obliterated on the lower
part of the vessel while the clay was yet soft. The fillets are not so well
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
smoothed down on the interior surface as usual, a ridged appearance
being the result. This comes from the difficulty of operating within a
much restricted aperture. The color is gray, with a few effective clouds
of black, the result of firing. Another, of similar form, was taken from
the collection by unknown persons.</p>

<p>The only example of coiled ware from this locality having a handle
is a small mug. Its body is shaped much like the larger vessels, but it
is less regular in outline. The single vertically placed handle, now partially
broken away, was attached to the side of the body near the top,
and consisted of a rough cord of clay less than half an inch in diameter.
The Saint George tumulus furnished a number of vessels with smooth,
unpainted surfaces, very similar in form and size to the coiled vessels.
They are generally blackened by use over fire, and, like the large coiled
pots, were evidently used for culinary purposes. A few smaller vessels
of the same style of finish exhibit forms characteristic of the painted
ware, as will be seen by reference to the illustrations of these two groups.</p>

<p>From the same source we have two bowls of especial interest, as they
have coiled exteriors and polished and painted interiors. One of these
is illustrated in Fig. 244. They form an important link between the two
varieties of ware, demonstrating the fact that both styles belong to
the same age and to the same people. A similar bowl, found in possession
of the Zuñi Indians, is illustrated in another part of this paper,
Fig. 254. Another was obtained at Moki. Fragments of identical vessels
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>
are found occasionally throughout the whole Pueblo district. One piece
from the San Juan Valley has figures painted upon the coiled exterior
surface, the interior being polished and unpainted. Specimens from the
vicinity of Springerville, Arizona, have designs in white painted over
the coiled surface. A large number of well-made, hemispherical bowls
from this locality have a coiled band about the exterior margin, but are
otherwise plain and well polished. Some are brownish or reddish in
color. Many of them have been used over the fire.</p>

</div>

<p>The ceramic remains of Utah present some puzzling features. As we
go north from the Rio Virgen there is an apparent gradation from the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
typical Pueblo ware to a distinct group characteristic of Salt Lake Valley.
The interesting problems suggested by this condition of things
cannot be discussed in this place, and I will stop only to present a
specimen of the coiled ware from Parowan, which is in some respects
the finest example known. The form, so far as it is preserved, seems
unusually graceful, and the laying and indenting of the coil is surprisingly
perfect. This vase is in the Salt Lake Museum, and the cut, Fig.
245, is made from a photograph furnished by Prof. Marcus E. Jones.
Vessels with similar finish have recently been obtained from graves at
Fillmore, Utah, by Dr. H. C. Yarrow, and, singularly enough, identical
work is seen in some very fine pieces obtained by Mr. Nelson from
ruined pueblos in middle eastern Arizona.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 246</span>.&mdash;Cup from central Utah.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>An interesting little cup, said to have been found in central Utah,
illustrates some of the peculiar characters of the more northern examples
of this ware. The vessel has apparently been built with coils, as
usual, but the surface is worked over in such a way as to obscure the
spiral ridges. The rim is upright and plain. The high, wide neck has
a series of narrow, vertical flutings, made with a round-pointed implement,
or possibly with the finger tip. A band of four channels encircles
the middle of the body, the lower part of which is covered with
oblique markings.</p>

<p>The handle is large and round, and is attached above to the top of the
rim, and below to the middle of the body. This cup is now in the museum
at Salt Lake. The photograph from which the engraving is
made was obtained through Professor Jones.</p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE LITTLE COLORADO.</h4>

<p>The region now inhabited by the Pueblo tribes seems to have been
a favorite residence of the ancient peoples. Ruins and remains of
ceramic art may be found at every turn, and it is a common thing to
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
find ancient vessels in possession of the Pueblo Indians. This is especially
true of the Zuñis and Mokis, from whom considerable collections
have been obtained. These vessels have apparently been culled
from the sites of ancient ruins, from cave and cliff-houses, and possibly
in some cases from burial places. Recently, since they have become valuable
in trade, the country about Moki has been ransacked by both Indians
and whites, and many valuable specimens have been acquired.</p>

<p>Within recent years a number of expeditions have been sent into this
region. To these the cañons and cliffs have yielded many specimens.
Both Mr. Stevenson and Mr. Victor Mindeleff have brought in excellent
examples, a few of which have already been illustrated in the publications
of the Bureau of Ethnology. I must not fail to mention the
very extensive collection of Mr. T. V. Keam and his associate, Mr. John
Stephen, examples from which I am permitted to illustrate in this paper.</p>

<p>Most of the pieces described by Mr. Stevenson are small and not at all
pleasing in appearance. They comprise ollas and handled mugs of
an elongated scrotoid or sack shape, the widest part of the body being,
as a rule, near the base, while the upper part is elongated into a heavy
neck, to which a recurved rim has been added.</p>

<p>A number of examples, illustrated in the Second Annual Report of
the Bureau of Ethnology, were obtained from the Zuñi Indians, and are
thought by Mr. Stevenson to have come from the Cañon de Chelly.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">

</div>

<p>A large, very badly constructed specimen is given in Fig. 247. The
rim is roughly finished, the body unsymmetrical, and the bottom slightly
flattened. The coils differ greatly in width, and are carelessly joined
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span>
and unevenly indented. The rudeness of workmanship noticed in this
case is characteristic of many of the specimens from Zuñi.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 249</span>.&mdash;Handled mug from Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>A rudely constructed cylindrical cup, of the wide-mouthed, narrow-bodied
variety, is illustrated in Fig. 248. The bottom was flattened by
contact with some hard, scarred surface before the clay hardened. Two
round, tapering, serpent-like fillets of clay have been fixed in a vertical
position upon opposite sides of the vessel.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>There are a number of handled vessels of this class. They are mostly
rather rudely made and unsymmetrical. They are small in size and
were probably devoted to ordinary domestic uses. A good specimen
from the Keam collection is shown in Fig. 249. The handle in this
case is a large loop made of three ropes of clay placed side by side. In
one case there are three strands set side by side, and joined near the
ends. In another case the strands have been twisted, giving a rope-like
effect. These forms closely resemble wicker handles in appearance
and manner of attachment, and are probably to some extent derived
from them, although there is no reason why the ropes of clay, in constant
use by potters, should not be joined in pairs, or even twisted, if
greater strength or variety were desired.</p>

<p>Vessels from the province of Tusayan may often be identified by their
color, which, like that of the transition and modern wares of the same
region, is often a rich yellow, sometimes approaching an orange. This
color is probably a result of changes in the natural constituents of the
clay employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 250</span>.&mdash;Yellow vase from Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>An excellent example of the yellow coiled vases is illustrated in Fig.
250. It has a new look, and probably belongs to a later period than the
light gray ware of the district. It is symmetrical, and the coil is neatly
laid and indented. Portions of the sides and base were blackened in
firing.</p>

<p>There are a number of fine specimens of this class in the Keam collection,
all obtained from the ancient province of Tusayan. A small,
wide-necked pot is shown in Fig. 251. The surface is smooth, with the
exception of a narrow band or collar about the neck, formed of a few
indented coils. Other vessels closely resembling this in style are much
larger and heavier.

<p>A vessel of very archaic appearance is illustrated in Fig. 252. In
form, color, and finish it differs from the preceding example. The
mouth is almost as wide as the body at its greatest circumference, the
color is gray, and the coils are narrow and regularly indented. A minute
coiled fillet is attached to the rim for ornament.</p>

<p>The vessel illustrated in Fig. 253 is one of the most noteworthy of
its class. In form and construction it does not differ essentially from
specimens already described, but the decoration is superior. The coils
are indented in such a way as to produce a pattern of triangular figures,
which is carried over the entire surface of the vessel. It belongs to the
Keam collection, and comes from the province of Tusayan.

<p>From Cibola we have a bowl, the exterior of which is coiled and the
interior polished and painted. It is undoubtedly of the most archaic
variety of ware, and is almost a duplicate of the example from the Saint
George tumulus, shown in Fig. 244. The interior is encircled by a
series of five triangular volutes in black lines, and the exterior exhibits
a very neatly laid and indented coil. Fig. 254.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span></p>


<h4>PECOS AND THE RIO GRANDE.</h4>

<p>In New Mexico, upwards of four hundred miles east of Saint George,
in the handsome upland valley of the Rio Pecos, we have the most easterly
of the ancient Pueblo remains. The site was occupied at the time
of the conquest, but is now wholly deserted, a small remnant of the people
having gone to dwell with their kindred at Jémez.</p>

<p>The site of this village has been thoroughly examined by that learned
gentleman, Mr. A. F. Bandelier. It is his opinion that the remains show
at least two distinct periods of occupation, the first being marked
chiefly by a stratum of ashes, pottery, etc., of great horizontal extent.
This underlies more recent deposits which belong to the people found
in possession, and whose arts are nearly identical with those of the existing
Pueblos.</p>

<p>The underlying stratum is characterized by great quantities of fragmentary
coiled ware uniform with that of more western localities. At
the same time there is almost a total absence of painted pottery.</p>

<p>The conclusion reached by Mr. Bandelier is that probably the coiled
pottery wherever found marks the occupancy of a people antecedent to
those who made painted ware. It is my impression, as already stated,
that the coiled form may be the most archaic of the ancient Pueblo
pottery, yet I think it best to notice two things in regard to the conditions
at Pecos.</p>

<p>In the first place, it should be remembered that the painted pottery
found by Mr. Bandelier is said to resemble that of Nambe of to-day,
nothing being said of the painted ware characteristic of the ancient
ruins of the west, and which is always found associated with the coiled
fragments, as at Saint George, in the same graves and even in the same
vessel, Fig. 244. We would not expect in Pecos, or in any other place,
to find modern Pueblo ware like the more recent pottery from Pecos intimately
associated with the ancient ware either painted or corrugated.
The only strange feature at Pecos is that the coiled fragments are not
associated with ancient painted ware as in other places.</p>

<p>Mr. Bandelier advances the idea that this deposit of corrugated ware
may represent the site of an ancient pottery, where the vessels were
laid out in heaps surrounded by fuel and burned as by the modern
Pueblo potters, the broken pieces being left on the ground, forming
finally a considerable stratum. If this is correct, then the true explanation
probably is that on this spot only the one variety of pottery was
made, the painted pottery of the same locality, if such was in use, being
made by potters in other parts of the village. Unless there is an actual
superposition of the ancient painted ware upon deposits of the coiled
variety, we learn nothing of chronological importance.</p>

<p>The valley of the Rio Grande has furnished but few specimens of the
coiled ware, although it is known to occur along nearly its entire course
through New Mexico.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE RIO GILA.</h4>

<p>The broad area drained by the Gila River and its tributaries abounds
in ruins and relics, but its exploration is yet very incomplete. Coiled
pottery identical, in nearly every respect, with that of the more northern
valleys is abundant, but it is sometimes associated with painted wares
very different in style from those of the cliff-house districts. It will
probably be found that the ceramic products of the Rio Gila and the
Rio Grande are much less homogeneous than those of the Colorado Chiquito,
the San Juan, and the Rio Virgen.</p>


<h3>IMITATION COIL-WARE.</h3>

<p>I have already mentioned the occurrence in the Pueblo towns of modern
coiled pottery, and also that there are seen, occasionally, vessels in
which the coiled effect is rudely imitated by means of scarifying and
indenting the plastic surface. Specimens of the latter class are generally
small rude bottles with wide recurved lips and slightly conical
bases. They are very rudely made and clumsy and are but slightly
baked, and on account of the omission of proper tempering material are
extremely brittle. They are new looking, and in no case show indications
of use, and I have seen no example worthy of a place upon our
museum shelves save as illustrating the trickery of the makers. It is
possible that they are made by the Mokis, but if so by very unskilled
persons who have neither understood the methods nor employed the
same materials as the professional potters. I consider it highly probable
that some clever Navajo has thought, by imitating archaic types of
ware, to outwit collectors and turn an honest penny.</p>

<h3>PLAIN WARE.</h3>

<p>All the groups of pottery furnish examples of plain vessels. These
are generally rudely finished and heavy, as if intended for the more ordinary
domestic uses, such as the cooking of food and the storing of
provisions and water. The material is coarser than in the nicely finished
pieces and the surface is without the usual slip and without polish or
applied color.</p>

<p>The characters of these utensils are quite uniform throughout very
widely separated districts, so that it is more difficult to assign a single
vessel to its proper family than in the case of decorated wares.</p>

<p>We have from Saint George and other localities examples of plain
vessels that belong, without a doubt, to the coiled variety, the resemblance
in material, color, shape, and finish being quite marked.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span></p>

<p>These vessels are plentiful in the province of Tusayan, and many of
them, as indicated by their color, construction, and texture, belong to
the yellow and orange groups of ancient coiled ware. There is in many
cases an easily discernible gradation from the wholly coiled through the
partially coiled to the plain ware. In some cases the coil has been so
imperfectly smoothed down that obscure ribs encircle the vessel indicating
its direction, and in other cases fractures extend along the junction
lines, separating the vessel when broken, into its original coils.
These vessels are large and heavy, with wide mouths and full bodies,
which are occasionally somewhat compressed laterally, giving an oval
aperture.</p>

<p>Similar pithoi like vessels are in daily use by the Mokis and also by
the Zuñis, Acomas, Yumas, and others. They are employed in cooking
the messes for feasts and large gatherings, for dyeing wool, and for storing
various household materials. The modern work is so like the ancient
that it is difficult in many cases to distinguish the one from the other.</p>

<p>Besides the typical pot or cask there are many varieties of plain vessels,
some of which appear to be closely related to, or even identical
with, the classes usually finished in color. These include bowls, pots,
and bottles. I present three examples from the tumulus at Saint
George, Utah. The little bottle, shown in Fig. 255, is remarkable in
having a subtriangular shape, three nearly symmetrical nodes occurring
about the most expanded part of the body. An interesting series of
similar vessels has been obtained from Tusayan, some of which are decidedly
askoidal in shape.</p>

<p>Similar to the last in general outline is the curious vessel given in
Fig. 256. It was obtained in Southern Utah, and is now in possession
of the Salt Lake City Museum. The three nodes are very prominent
and curve upwards at the points like horns. An upright handle is
attached to the side of the neck.

<p>A large bottle-shaped vessel from the same locality is illustrated in
Fig. 257. The neck is short and widens rapidly below. The body is
large and globular, and is furnished with two small perforated ears
placed at the sides near the top. There are a number of similar examples
in the collection from this place. We have also a number of handled
cups, mostly with globular bodies and wide apertures. All are
quite plain.</p>

<h3>PAINTED WARE.</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Preliminary remarks.</span>&mdash;It is with a peculiar sense of delight that
we enter upon the study of a group of art products so full of new and
interesting features. Every object of antiquity has its charm for us, but
there is an especial fascination about the works of a people like the
"cliff-dwellers," whose long forgotten history takes the form of a romance
in our imaginations. In the study of these relics we have the
additional charm engendered by a contemplation of new forms of
beauty, and we follow the stages of their evolution from the initial steps
to the end with ever increasing zest.</p>

<p>The ceramic art of classic and oriental countries has exerted a powerful
influence upon existing culture, and is therefore much nearer the
heart of the general student than the work of the American races; but it
will not do for science to underrate the value of a study of the latter.
Its thorough examination cannot fail to furnish many illustrations of the
methods by which arts grow and races advance in culture, and, supplemented
by a study of the art of the modern peoples, it will serve to illustrate
the interesting phenomena attending the contact of widely separated
grades of art. In the introductory pages I have considered many
of the technical questions of construction and ornamentation. Before
entering upon detailed descriptions of the specimens, I desire to give a
brief review of the subject of painted decoration.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Color of designs.</span>&mdash;The colors employed are doubtless generally
of a mineral character, although carbonaceous matter derived
directly from vegetable sources may have been used to some extent.
They comprised white, black, red, and various shades of brown, and
were applied to the surfaces of the vessels by means of brushes not inferior
in efficiency to those employed by the potters of more enlightened
races.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Execution.</span>&mdash;The technical skill of the artist has not generally been
of a high order, although examples are found that indicate a trained eye
and a skilled hand. The designs are painted upon the show spaces of
the vessels, which have been tinted and polished with especial reference
to their reception. Large apertured vessels, such as dishes, cups, and
bowls, are decorated chiefly upon the inner surface. The design often
occupies only a band about the rim, but not infrequently covers the entire
inner surface. High or incurved rims have in some cases received
figures upon the exterior margin.</p>

<p>Vessels with constricted necks have exterior decorations only. The
placing of the designs was governed, to a great extent, by the contour
of the vessel, although there was no fixed rule. The grouping of the figures
is possibly a little more irregular in the more archaic forms, but in
nearly all cases there is a tendency toward arrangement in zones horizontally
encircling the vessel. This feature is suggestive of the use of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
the wheel or of the influence of wheel-made decoration; but there is
probably a pre-ceramic reason for this peculiarity, to be sought in the
decoration of antecedent vessels of more pronounced surface or constructional
characters, such as basketry. This arrangement may also
be attributed in a measure to the conformation of the vessel decorated.
It will be observed that generally the neck furnishes the space for one
zone of devices and the body that for another, while the shoulder, where
wide or particularly accentuated, suggests the introduction of a third.
In vessels of irregular form the figures take such positions as happen
to have been suggested to the decorator by the available spaces, by the
demands of superstition, or the dictates of fancy pure and simple.</p>

<p>It appears that the artist never worked in a hap-hazard manner, yet
never by rule or by pattern. The conception of the intended design
was well formed in the mind, and the decoration commenced with a thorough
understanding of the requirements of the vessel under treatment
and of the effect of each added line upon the complete result. The vessels,
being for the most part free-hand products, are necessarily varied
in form and proportion, and the mobility of method in decoration is
therefore a necessary as well as a natural condition. In accommodating
the ordinary geometric figures to the variously curved and uneven surfaces,
there were no erasures and, apparently, no embarrassments. This
feature of the art shows it to be a native and spontaneous growth&mdash;the
untrammeled working out of traditional conceptions by native gifts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Stages of ornament.</span>&mdash;In the transmission of a nation's art inheritance
from generation to generation, all the original forms of ornament
undergo changes by alterations, eliminations, or additions. At
the end of a long period we find the style of decoration so modified as
to be hardly recognizable as the work of the same people; yet rapid
changes would not occur in the uninterrupted course of evolution, for
there is a wonderful stability about the arts, institutions, and beliefs of
primitive races. Change of environment has a decided tendency to
modify, and contact with other peoples, especially if of a high grade of
culture, is liable to revolutionize the whole character of the art. The
manufactures of our modern tribes show abundant evidence of the demoralizing
effect upon native art of contact with the whites. There are
no such features in the prehistoric art.</p>

<p><i>First stage.</i>&mdash;In the early stages of art the elements used in embellishment
are greatly non-ideographic, and the forms of expression are chiefly
geometric. The elements or motives are limited in number and are in a
measure common to all archaic art. They embrace dots, straight lines,
and various angular and curvilinear figures, which in their higher stages
become checkers, zigzags, chevrons, complex forms of meanders, fretted
figures, and scrolls, with an infinite variety of combination and detail.
At the same time there is no confusion. The processes by which the
parts are segregated are as well regulated as are the processes of natural
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
growth. This phase of decoration seems to be the prevailing one in
the earlier stages of Pueblo art.</p>

<p><i>Second stage.</i>&mdash;A second phase or stage is marked by the free introduction
of ideographic devices of pictorial origin into decoration. These
are drawn, to a great extent, from that most prolific source of artistic
conceptions, mythology. This stage is the second in Pueblo art. The
period or stage of culture at which such elements are introduced varies
with different peoples. It is possible that ideographic and non-ideographic
devices may enter art simultaneously. This is certainly to be
expected in the ceramic art, which comes into existence rather late in
the course of progress.</p>

<p><i>Third stage.</i>&mdash;In strong contrast with the preceding stages is the state
of modern Pueblo decoration. Contact with the whites has led to the
introduction of life forms and varied pictorial delineations. These conditions
belong to a stage in advance of the position reached in the natural
course of growth. Ideographic, non-ideographic, and purely pictorial
characters are combined in the most heterogeneous manner in the decoration
of a single vessel. The decorator has ceased to work under the
guidance of his instincts as a rule unerring, and now, like the mass of
his more highly civilized brethren, he must grope in darkness until
culture shall come to his aid with canons of taste&mdash;the product of intellect.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification of ware.</span>&mdash;In the treatment of this great group, or
rather collection of groups, of pottery a scheme of classification is the
first thing to be considered. In glancing over the field we notice that
a whitish ware, having a certain range of material, finish, form, and
decoration, is very widely distributed, that, in fact, it is found over
nearly the entire area known to have been occupied by the Pueblo
tribes. We find, however, that within this area there are varieties of
this particular group distinguished by more or less pronounced peculiarities
of color, form, and ornament, resulting from dissimilarity of environment
rather than from differences in time, race, or method of construction.
This group is associated, in nearly every locality, with the archaic
coiled ware, and together they are especially typical of the first great
period of Pueblo art. Its makers were the builders of the cliff dwellings,
of the round towers, and of countless stone pueblos.</p>

<p>Distinct from the preceding, and apparently occupying an intermediate
place in time and culture between the primitive and the recent wares,
we have a number of pretty well defined groups. At least two of these
are peculiar to the ancient province of Tusayan. The vessels of one of
these groups are noticeable for their rounded symmetrical bodies, their
finely textured paste, and their delicate creamy shades of color. The
designs are well executed and display unusual refinement of taste.</p>

<p>Another, and probably the more important variety, is characterized,
first, by peculiarities of form, the body being doubly conical and the
bottom deeply indented; second, by richness of color, orange and yellow
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
tints prevailing; and, third, by the striking individuality and remarkable
execution of the painted designs.</p>

<p>In the valley of the Little Colorado and extending southward to the
Gila, we find remnants of a group of highly colored pottery differing from
the preceding and, in many respects, from the widely distributed red ware
of the north, specimens of which occur in connection with the white
ware. The surfaces are painted red and profusely decorated in white,
black, and red lines and figures.</p>

<p>Still another variety is obtained from this region. As indicated by
collections from Saint John and Springerville, it consists greatly of
bowls, the colors, forms, and decorations having decided points of resemblance
to corresponding features of the cream-colored ware of ancient
Tusayan. There are still other groups, probably of intermediary periods,
whose limits are not yet well defined, examples of which are found in
possession of the Pueblo Indians.</p>

<p>At Pecos the art was practiced long after the advent of the conquerors,
and later specimens show the archaic decorative ideas worked out
in Spanish glaze. The deserted pueblos of the Rio Grande furnish antique
forms that show wide distinctions from the ancient wares of the
west. Another variety peculiar to the southwest shows indications of
having been carried down to the present in the work of the Indians of
the Lower Colorado Valley. Each of these groups and such new ones
as may be discovered will be made the subject of careful study.</p>

<p>The remainder of this paper will be devoted to a single group&mdash;the
first mentioned in the preceding list.</p>


<h4>WHITE WARE.</h4>

<p>The coiled ware has already been presented in some detail. Most
nearly related to it in material, form, color, and distribution is the
archaic white ware, the pottery <i>par excellance</i> of the "Cliff-Dwellers."
It is easily recognized, even from small fragments, whether found in the
valley of the Colorado, of the Rio Grande, or of the Gila, although each locality
has its slight peculiarities of texture, tint, shape, and ornamentation.
As a rule the material is a fine-grained clay, tempered with fine
sand, the surfaces of the vessels being coated with a thin wash of very
fine white clay. The ware is nearly always well baked and hard, breaking
with a saccharoidal, rarely with a conchoidal, fracture. The surface is,
as a rule, well polished, but often slightly undulating. The color of the
paste is generally gray within the mass and white upon the surface.
Associated with the white ware in most localities we find a small percentage
of red ware nearly identical in all save color with the white ware.</p>

<p>The forms are comparatively few and simple, a full, well-rounded
body, as with the coiled ware, being a strong characteristic. The ornamentation
is generally in black paint, exceptionally in red and white,
and consists to a great extent of geometric figures, often rather rudely
drawn. Very rarely we observe an attempt to delineate a life form&mdash;human
or animal, never vegetable.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Classification by form.</span>&mdash;The ware of each province is conveniently
presented in form-groups, beginning with the more simple shapes
and advancing to the more complex.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowls.</span>&mdash;Bowl-shaped vessels have been in great favor with all the
Pueblo peoples, and in ancient times, especially in the north and west,
predominated very decidedly over all other forms. This is naturally a
favorite shape with primitive peoples, as it is the most simple and probably
that first developed. A long experience would be necessary for
the evolution of narrow-necked or complex forms.</p>

<p>Our collections contain many examples of ancient bowls, perfectly
preserved, but if this were not the case the shapes are so simple that it
would be an easy matter to make satisfactory restorations from fragments.
There is considerable diversity of outline, yet all may be conveniently
classed under two heads: the hemispherical and the heart-shaped.
The former are much more plentiful and were probably the
favorite food vessels of the people. As a rule they are plain segments
of spheres. The rims are, in rare cases, oval in outline, and a few are
elongated at the ends.</p>

<p>Heart-shaped bowls are characterized by a somewhat conical base and
a deeply incurved rim, sometimes much depressed about the contracted
mouth. The forms are often elegant, and the painted designs are generally
well executed and pleasing to the eye.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ollas.</span>&mdash;Between bowls and pot-shaped vases or ollas there is but a
step&mdash;the addition of an upright or recurving band forming a neck.
In vessels of the latter class the body is almost universally globular,
often tapering a very little below. Occasionally there is a slight flattening
of the bottom and very rarely a concavity. The neck is seldom
high, but varies greatly in size and shape. These vessels correspond to
the water vases of the modern tribes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bottles.</span>&mdash;Bottle-shaped vessels are very widely distributed. They
differ from the ollas in one respect only&mdash;the necks are narrower and
higher. They are rarely flattened, as are the modern Pueblo bottles
known as canteens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handled vessels.</span>&mdash;Smaller vessels of nearly all shapes are at times
furnished with handles. The origin of certain forms of these has received
attention in the introductory pages. They vary in style with the
shape of the vessel to which they are attached. Bowls exhibit two well-marked
varieties&mdash;a cylindrical form and a simple loop. Those of the
former often imitate the handle-like neck of a gourd, and archaic specimens
from various parts of the Pueblo province are so literally copied
that the small curved stem of the gourd is represented. This feature in
some cases becomes a loop at the end of the handle, serving to suspend
the vessel, like the ring attached to our dipper handles. Specimens
from the headwaters of the Colorado Chiquito have the ends of the handles
modeled to represent the head of a serpents or other creatures. A
loop sometimes takes the place of the cylindrical handle, and is attached
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
to the side of the bowl in a vertical or a horizontal position. It
may be long or short, wide or narrow, simple or compound, and is not
always evenly curved. In certain forms of cups the vertically-placed
loop occupies the whole length of the vessel, suggesting well-known
forms of the beer-mug.</p>

<p>High-necked cups, vases, and bottles have rather long, vertically-placed
loops, giving a pitcher-like effect. These may consist of two or
more strands placed side by side or twisted together. Rarely an animal
form is imitated, the fore feet of the creature resting upon the rim
of the vessel and the hind feet upon the shoulder. Perforated knobs
often take the place of the loops, and unperforated nodes and projections
of varied shapes are not unusual. Some of these, placed upon
the upper part of the neck, represent the heads of animals.</p>

<p>A novel handle is sometimes seen in the ancient vases of Cibola and
Tusayan. While the clay was still soft a deep abrupt indentation was
made in the lower part of the vessel, sufficiently large to admit the
ends of two or three fingers, thus giving a hold that facilitated the
handling of the vessel. I have seen no looped handles arching the
aperture of the vessel, as in the modern meal baskets of the Zuñis.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eccentric and life forms.</span>&mdash;The simple potter of early Pueblo
times seems barely to have reached the period of eccentric and compound
forms, and animal and grotesque shapes, so common in the pottery
of the mound-builders of the Mississippi valley, the Mexicans, and
the Peruvians, are of rather rare occurrence. The last section of this
paper is devoted to life and eccentric forms.</p>

<p>For convenience of treatment, the following illustrations will be presented
by districts, beginning at the northwest.</p>

<h3>ILLUSTRATIONS.</h3>

<h4>DISTRICT OF THE RIO VIRGEN.</h4>

<p>Under the head of coiled pottery I have given a detailed description
of the remarkable dwelling-site tumulus at Saint George, Utah,
which has furnished such a complete set of the fictile works of the cliff-house
potter, the first collection of importance known to have been
made by exhumation. I will now present the painted ware and point
out its very interesting local peculiarities. All the ordinary shapes are
present excepting the olla. Vessels of this form are all of the plain or
coiled varieties. The paste is gray and the surface color is usually a
light gray. A small percentage of the vessels are painted or stained
red. The designs are all executed in black, and are for the most part
nicely drawn. They differ slightly in a number of ways from those of
other districts, their relationships being, with a few exceptions, more
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
intimate with the ware of the Rio San Juan. A characteristic of this
pottery is the thinness of the walls and the hardness and tenacity of
the paste. In form a striking feature is the occurrence of bowls of
oval form, and in one case such a bowl has sides cut down or scalloped
and ends prolonged. The oval form is sometimes seen in other districts,
and the elongation of portions of the rim is a feature especially
characteristic of the Pima and Mojave work of to-day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowls.</span>&mdash;I have already shown in Fig. 244 a small bowl from this
locality, in which a coiled exterior is combined with a polished and
painted interior. This is an unusual combination, the exterior commonly
being plain. The following examples are grouped, as far as
possible, according to their painted designs. A usual and very widely
distributed decoration consists of a belt of figures encircling the inner
margin. In its simplest condition it is only a single broad line, but
more frequently it is elaborated into a tasteful border so wide as to
leave only a small circle of the plain surface in the bottom of the vessel.
The figures present much variety of effect, but combine only a few elements
or ideas, as the following figures will amply show. All are rectilinear,
or as nearly so as the conformation of the vessels will permit.
No example of exterior decoration occurs. As my illustrations are
necessarily limited to a few pieces, those having the simpler combinations
of lines are omitted, and such only are given as exhibit the decorations
of this district to the best advantage.</p>

<p>The bowl shown in Fig. 258 may be regarded as a typical example.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<img src="images/308_dp535.jpg" width="450" height="289" alt="Fig. 258" title="Bowl: tumulus at Saint George." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 258</span>.&mdash;Bowl: tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.
</p></div>

<p>It is a plain hemisphere of gray clay, with roughly finished exterior
and whitened and polished interior surface. It is eight inches in diameter
and nearly four inches deep. The painted design occupies a band
about two inches wide, and consists of two broad bordering lines inclosing
meandered lines. The triangular interspaces are occupied by
serrate figures, giving to the whole ornament an appearance characteristic
of textile borders.</p>

<p>Two small bowls have borders in which the meandered lines are in
the natural color of the ground, the triangular spaces being filled in with
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309">309</a></span>
black. In one case the effect of the guilloche is given in the same
manner.</p>

<p>Few vessels exhibit a more characteristic example of the ornamentation
of this ware than that given in Fig. 259. It is identical in surface
finish with the last, excepting that the exterior has been painted red.
An exceptional feature may be noticed in the shaping of the rim, which
has been brought to a sharp edge.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/309_dp536a.jpg" id="p309_f259" >
<img src="images/309_dp536a.jpg" width="450" height="337" alt="Fig. 259" title="Bowl: tumulus at Saint George." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 259</span>.&mdash;Bowl: tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.
</p></div>

<p>The design occupies the usual space, and consists of a very elaborately
meandered or fretted line, which is so involved that the eye
follows it with difficulty. Four units of the combination complete the
circuit of the vessel. In another specimen, which also has the design
divided into four parts, the lower line of each part is made straight, by
which means the space left in the bottom of the vessel is square instead
of round, as in the other cases.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/309_dp536b.jpg" id="p309_f260" >
<img src="images/309_dp536b.jpg" width="450" height="253" alt="Fig. 260" title="Bowl: tumulus at Saint George." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 260</span>.&mdash;Bowl: tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.
</p></div>

<p>Another variety of decoration, quite characteristic of this region,
consists of a band of fret-work dashed boldly across the inner surface
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
of the bowl, giving a most striking result. These figures appear to
be fragments of continuous borders, taken from their proper connections
and made to do duty on a surface that had ordinarily been left
without decoration. This observation has led to the proper interpretation
of many enigmatic combinations at first thought to have
especial application and significance.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">
<a href="images/310_dp537a.jpg" id="p310_f261" >
<img src="images/310_dp537a.jpg" width="300" height="301" alt="Fig. 261" title="Painted device." /></a>
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 261</span>.&mdash;Painted device.
</p>
</div>

<p>The handsome shallow bowl presented in Fig. 260 has been badly
broken and carefully mended while still in the hands of its aboriginal
owners. It is ten and one-half inches in diameter, and only three
and three-fourths inches in depth. The surface finish is identical with
that of the preceding example. The design, which consists of a single
segment of a chain of fret-work, is drawn in broad, steady lines. Fig. 261.</p>

<p>Not unlike the last in its leading features is the vessel illustrated in
Fig. 262. The label indicates that it was collected at Kanab, Utah, a
Mormon village ninety miles east of Saint George. The design is carried
over the whole inner surface, and is somewhat difficult to analyze.
There is little doubt, however, that it consists of portions of fretted or
meandered patterns arbitrarily selected from basketry or other geometrically
embellished articles, and applied to this use. The complete
device is shown in Fig. 263.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/310_dp537b.jpg" id="p310_f262" >

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 262</span>.&mdash;Bowl from Kanab.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>.
</p>
</div>

<p>The following examples are unique in their styles of decoration. The
first, Fig. 264, resembles the preceding save in its painted device. Like
a few others, it has been badly fractured and carefully mended by its
Indian owners. It was obtained also at Kanab, and is nine inches in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
diameter by four and one-half in height. The design is cruciform in
arrangement, the four parts being joined in pairs by connecting lines.
It exhibits some very unusual features (Fig. 265), and we are led to
suspect that it may in some way have been significant, or at least that it is
a copy of some emblematic device.</p>

<div class="figright w50">
<a href="images/311_dp538a.jpg" id="p311_f263" >

</div>

<p>The almost total absence of life forms in the art of the primitive
Pueblos has often been remarked. One example only has been discovered
in this region. This occurs in a subject painted on the inner surface
of a rather rude, oblong, bowl, from the Saint George tumulus, Fig.
266. A checkered belt in black extends longitudinally across the bowl.
At the sides of this, near the middle, are two human figures, executed
in the most primitive style, as shown in Fig. 267. Their angular forms
are indicative of textile influence. The middle part of the bowl is
broken out, so that the feet of one figure and the head of the other are
lost.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/311_dp538b.jpg" id="p311_f264" >

<p>These figures resemble those painted upon and picked in the
rocks of the pueblo region, and the triangular head is sometimes seen
in the ceramic decoration of modern tribes. A bowl with similar figures
was brought from Tusayan by Mr. Mindeleff. It is illustrated in Fig.
268.

<p>Among the many fine things from the mound at Saint George are a
few red bowls. They were made of a slightly reddish clay, or the paste
has reddened uniformly in burning, and a slip or wash of bright red
color has been applied to the surface. The designs are painted in black,
but differ in style from any of the preceding. This work corresponds
very closely indeed with the decorations of similar vessels from the
Little Colorado. The marked peculiarities of the ornamentation and
color of these bowls give rise to the idea that they may have been intended
for some especial service of a ceremonial character. It is not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
impossible, however, that these vessels reached very distant localities
by means of trade. A representative example is shown in Fig. 269.
The broad interior band of ornament is divided into four compartments
by vertical panels of reticulated lines. The compartments are occupied
by groups of disconnected rectangular fret-links on a ground of
oblique stripes.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/313_dp540a.jpg" id="p313_f269" >

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 269</span>.&mdash;Red bowl: tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.
</p>
</div>

<p>The heart-shaped bowls previously mentioned include medium sized
and small vases, with slightly conical bases, distended shoulders, and
much constricted, often depressed, apertures. They are of very general
distribution, but like the hemispherical red bowls are rarely found in
numbers. It is probable that they were devoted to ceremonial rather
than to domestic uses. The shapes are generally pleasing to the eye;
the finish is exceptionally fine, and the designs, though simple, are applied
with more than usual care.</p>

<p>A very good specimen from the tumulus at Saint George is illustrated
in Fig. 270.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/313_dp540b.jpg" id="p313_f270" >

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 270</span>.&mdash;Heart shaped bowl of red ware: tumulus at Saint George.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.
</p>
</div>

<p>The bottom in this case is slightly flattened, and the incurved lip but
slightly sunken. The paste is a light red and the surface has received
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
a coat of bright red color. The design is in black, is extremely simple,
and rather carelessly drawn. The principal figure seems to be a very
simple form of the favorite device&mdash;the meander.</p>

<p>A large fine bowl much like the preceding, and obtained from the
same locality, is owned by the Salt Lake City Museum. The design is
of the same class, but very much more elaborate. Another example
from Saint George is smaller and yellowish-gray in color, with figures
in red and black. At Kanab I picked up fragments of a small vessel,
highly polished and of a rich, brownish-purple color, the designs being
in black. Another fragment showed designs in bright red and black
upon a yellowish ground.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ollas.</span>&mdash;I have already called attention to the fact, that the Saint
George tumulus furnished no example of ollas or large-necked vases
of the painted variety, vessels of this class being plain or of the coiled
ware. In the vicinity, however, I collected fragments of the white
painted pottery derived from large vessels of this class, very much like
the large, handsome vessels of ancient Tusayan. A number of such
fragments come from the vicinity of Kanab. Plain vessels of this
shape were obtained from the tumulus at Saint George. They are identical
in every other respect, save the presence of designs, with the
painted pottery. Some have received a wash of red, while it is not improbable
that others have lost their color or decorative figures by wear
or weather.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handled vessels.</span>&mdash;From the tumulus at Saint George we have a
very excellent example of pitcher, which is shown in Fig. 271. The
shape is not quite satisfactory, the neck being clumsy, but the workmanship
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
is exceptionally good. The surface is even and well polished and
the color is a strong red. The painted design in black, upon the red
ground, consists of a number of meandered lines, to which are added
at intervals small dentate figures, as seen in the cut.</p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE RIO SAN JUAN.</h4>

<p>In a number of ways the valley of the Rio San Juan possesses unusual
interest to the antiquarian. Until within the latter half of the nineteenth
century, it remained wholly unknown. The early Spanish expeditions
are not known to have penetrated its secluded precincts, and
its cliff-houses, its ruined pueblos and curious towers have been so long
deserted that it is doubtful whether even a tradition of their occupation
has been preserved, either by the nomadic tribes of the district or by the
modern pueblos of the south. Certain it is that no foreign hand has influenced
the art of this district, and no Spanish adventurer has left
traces of his presence.</p>

<p>The ceramic remains are more uniform in character and apparently
more archaic in decoration than those of any other district. They
belong almost exclusively to two varieties, the coiled ware and the white
ware with black figures. The former has already been described, the
latter must now pass under review.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that so few entire vessels of the painted pottery
have been found in this region. The fragments, however, are very
plentiful, and by proper study of these a great deal can be done to restore
the various forms of vessels. In my paper upon this region, in
the Annual Report of the Survey of the Territories for 1876, I gave a
pretty careful review of the material then in hand. Finding that in
very few cases were there whole vessels representing the achievements of
the ancient potter and decorator, I presented a number of restorations
from the better class of fragments. This was done in a way that could
lead to no serious misapprehension, as the fragments used were always
clearly indicated. The expert need never go astray in his estimate of
the character of the vessel to which given pieces belonged, and his
restoration from them gives a completeness of conception to the reader
or student at a distance that could never be acquired by the most careful
study of illustrations of the fragments. The fragments are exceedingly
plentiful about camp sites and ruins, and fairly whiten the debris
slopes beneath the houses in the cliffs. I found my mind so diverted
by these fascinating relics that it was often difficult to keep the geologic
problems of the district properly in view.</p>

<p>No tumuli or burial places were observed, but I suspect that careful
search will bring them to light, and that they will yield much richer
results than the scattered fragments of the surface. The district now
under consideration comprises the entire drainage of the Rio San Juan.
It includes the well-known valleys of the Animas, the La Plata, the
Mancos, the McElmel, and the Montezuma on the north, and the Chaco
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
and the de Chelly on the south. On the north I include also a portion of
the valley of the Rio Dolores. The center of the district will not be
very far distant from the corner stone of the four political divisions of
Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah.</p>

<p>The collections from the valley of the Rio de Chelly, one of the richest
sections of this district, are very badly scattered, and the vessels cannot
be identified. Many fine things have been carried away to the south
and are now in the collections from Cibola and Tusayan; while others
have been brought east by the various expeditions without a proper
record of the locality. This is to be regretted, as it makes it impossible
to study the shades of distinction between the wares of neighboring
localities.</p>

<p>Bowls were very numerous and greatly varied in size, finish, and ornamentation.
Many have received painted designs both inside and
out. This occurs with those having nearly upright rims. Handled-cups
of hemispherical shape are also common, but the heart-shaped bowls
are of rare occurrence. Bottle-shaped vessels and ollas have not, as in
the south, formed a prominent feature. For some of the latter very neat
lids have been made, the rims being shaped for their reception. Upright
vessels with handles are common. Eccentric or animal forms have not
been found.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowls.</span>&mdash;The arrangement of the designs upon the bowls is far from
uniform. In a great majority of cases, however, they occupy belts encircling
the inner and outer margin. The fragmentary condition of the
remains makes it impossible to restore designs that covered the entire
surface of the vessels. The decorations comprise nearly all the usual
elements and motives. In Fig. 272 we have a small bowl from Montezuma
Cañon, Utah. In form it is a deep hemisphere. The design is
upon the interior surface, and consists of a broad band bordered by
heavy lines and filled in with vertical lines. The rim is ornamented
with seven pairs of dots. Fig. 273 is restored from a fragment obtained
in southwest Colorado. It shows an interior ornament consisting of a
well-drawn chain of volutes.</p>

<p>Many of the bowls were large and handsomely finished, both surfaces
being whitened and polished. A superior example is given in Fig. 274.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
Neat borders have been applied to both interior and exterior surfaces.
They are suggestive of patterns produced through the technique of textile
products, and consist of interrupted forms of the meander. I have
restored from small fragments in this and other cases, for the reason
that no large fragments of the finer vessels are preserved.</p>

<p>Fig. 275 illustrates a very pleasing vessel. It is hemispherical, and
about eleven inches in diameter. A narrow zone of ornament based
upon the meander encircles the exterior margin of the rim, and a broad,
carefully drawn design, consisting of two parallel meanders, Fig. 276,
occupies the interior. It will be seen that the meandered fillets are
in white, and the bordering stripes and the upper and lower rows of
triangular interspaces are in solid black, while the median band and its
connecting triangles are obliquely striped. It should be noticed that
the oblique portions of the meanders are indented or stepped. This is
a very usual occurrence in these decorations, and may be taken as a
pretty decided indication that they were copied, more or less directly,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
from textile ornamentation in which all oblique lines are necessarily
stepped.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handled cups.</span>&mdash;Small cups were generally furnished with handles
and probably served as ladles and spoons. An entire specimen is rarely
found. Two are illustrated in Figs. 277 and 278. They were obtained
by W. H. Jackson from the ruins of Montezuma Cañon. The handles
of these vessels vary a great deal; some are flat, while others are round,
consisting either of a single or a looped roll of clay; some are hollow,
resembling the handles of gourds, and a few are made of twisted fillets.
This latter form belongs generally to upright cups.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ollas.</span>&mdash;It is quite impossible to make satisfactory restorations of
the vases or ollas from the small fragments recovered. The evidence is
sufficient, however, to show that
vessels of this class were numerous,
and often large. I have
made two restorations of small
examples belonging to this class,
of which there are fragments
showing the neck and upper
part of the bodies. The bottoms
are so universally rounded
that I have drawn full globular
shapes; Figs. 279 and 280. The
most striking character of Fig.
279 is the shape of the rim,
which is fashioned for the reception
of a lid. The same feature
is noticed in a small vessel obtained at Zuñi.

<p>Examples of lids from the San Juan Valley are shown in Figs. 281 and

<p><span class="smcap">Handled vases.</span>&mdash;Many small vessels were furnished with handles,
some horizontal and others vertical. Of the first variety is the example
shown in Fig. 283. The fragment was obtained from the great ruin at
"Aztec Springs," Colorado. It shows a small, symmetrical vessel, with
black lines and devices. The handle, which probably had a companion on
the opposite side, is strong and neatly made.</p>

<p>Figure 284 represents a very pretty little vessel, brought by Mr. W.
H. Jackson from the Cañon de Chelly. It is of the usual gray polished
ware, the base being somewhat roughened by use. The design consists
of encircling lines combined with a belt of disconnected triangular hooks
or fret-links.</p>

<p>Handled mugs with round bodies and wide high necks were in great
favor with the San Juan potter. There are but two entire specimens
in the collection. These were obtained by Capt. Moss, of Parrott, who
stated that they, with other relics, had been exhumed from a grave in
the San Juan Valley. Both are comparatively rude in construction, and
seem to be considerably weathered.
The one shown in Fig. 285 is decorated
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
with a classic meander which encircles the body of the vessel. The
other, illustrated in Fig. 286, has the upper part covered with simple
figures resembling bird tracks.</p>

<p>Among the most novel works of
the ancient potter are the flat-bottomed
mugs with upright sides, and
with vertical handles which extend
the whole length of the vessel, giving
very much the appearance of a
German beer mug. For a long time
it was thought improbable that a
vessel of this character should be
the <i>bona fide</i> work of the cliff-dweller,
for his status of culture seemed to
call for globular bodies and rounded
bases. But so many examples have
been found that there is no longer room for doubt.</p>

<p>Fig. 287 is restored from a large fragment brought from the San Juan
Valley. Its walls widen a little below, and the very pretty ornament is
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
somewhat unevenly applied. The handle is made of a double rope of
clay, and extends from the lip to the base. The example shown in Fig.
288 was obtained in the vicinity of Provo, Utah, by Capt. G. M. Wheeler's
expedition. It is so like those from the San Juan that I place it here
for comparison. It is a little wider toward the base, and is nearly symmetrical.
It is four inches in height and the same in diameter. A very
similar vessel, probably from the Province of Tusayan, is found in the
Keam collection.</p>


<h4>DISTRICT OF THE COLORADO CHIQUITO.</h4>

<p>The collection from this district, which includes the ancient provinces
of Cibola and Tusayan, is already very large, and much more material
will yet accrue, for pottery fanciers have taken up the search, and both
whites and Indians are on the <i>qui vive</i> for additional examples of the
artistic and showy specimens.</p>

<p>The National Museum has procured many fine pieces through the
agents of the Bureau of Ethnology, and the collection of Mr. Keam is
especially rich in the pottery of Tusayan. Some of the finer examples
of the latter collection are selected for illustration.</p>

<p>It seems unaccountable that such a large number of the ancient vessels
should be preserved, and that too in a country where vessels are
constantly in demand. Many have been picked up by the Pueblo tribes
and laid away for especial uses or possibly as heirlooms; but many of
those secured by recent collectors were obtained from the sites of ancient
settlements, from burial places, and from caves, and brought directly
to the market so recently made for them.</p>

<p>There can be no doubt that many of the specimens accredited to this
district have come from neighboring or distant provinces; yet within
the valley of the Little Colorado there are such wide variations from
predominant types that foreign pieces cannot be readily detected. Many
of the finer pieces of the white ware are rather new looking and show
very superior taste and skill. The indications are that the manufacture
of this white ware was kept up in portions of this district down to a
comparatively recent date, possibly until the coming of the Europeans.
It will probably be impossible to determine just why and how the
archaic types gave way to the transitional and modern. It may be
found, however, that the influence of the Spaniard was a factor in the
change.</p>

<p>Beside the archaic white ware and its closely associated red ware
the province of Tusayan furnishes two or three distinct varieties, all of
which, unlike that ware, are apparently confined to very limited districts.
These have been briefly described on a preceding page.</p>

<p>Many pieces of the white ware are of large size and of elegant shape
and finish. Some of the ollas and bottles are masterpieces of the art.
The texture of the paste is fine and the color is often quite white. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322">322</a></span>
designs are uniformly in black and are superior in execution and conception
to those of the north.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bowls.</span>&mdash;The bowls are very generally hemispherical. The finish,
like that of the pottery of the San Juan and the Rio Virgen, is rather
rough on the exterior, and whitened and polished on the inner surface.
The painted figures are confined to the interior, and are highly elaborated
combinations of the usual geometric motives. They are generally
made up of four sections of double-zoned borders such as occur
on the exterior of vases, cut out, as it were, and fitted into the bowl in
a cruciform arrangement, a plain square remaining in the bottom of the
vessel. See Fig. 291. There are, however, many examples which consist
of two encircling zones of ornament identical in style and arrangement
with examples from the Rio Virgen, Figs. 230 and 231, and from
the Rio San Juan, Figs. 248, 259, and 274.</p>

<p>In Fig. 289 we have a representative example of the bowls of ancient
Tusayan. The outer surface is rudely trowel-finished, but the inside is
well polished. The painted design consists of four parts arranged about
a central square. Each part comprises a number of alternate bands of
straight and zigzag lines.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 289</span>.&mdash;Bowl: Province of Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>The superb bowl presented in Fig. 290 is nearly fifteen inches in diameter
and seven inches deep. It is hemispherical but not quite symmetrical.
Having been broken, it was mended by its owners after their
aboriginal fashion. Two pairs of holes have been bored on opposite
sides of a long fracture for the insertion of thongs. Other perforations
have been commenced but do not penetrate the vessel. The walls are
upwards of one-eighth of an inch in thickness near the rim, but are less
than that throughout the body of the bowl. The paste is of a dark gray
color, speckled with ashy-white particles, which may be pulverized
potsherds. The interior surface is finished with a slip of white clay
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>
and has received a fair degree of polish. The exterior is only trowel-finished
and is much scarified by use. The interior is embellished with
a very elaborate design, which is given with all possible accuracy in a
plain projection, in Fig. 291. The work does not exhibit a great deal of
skill or neatness in execution, but the whole design is carefully made out
and well adjusted to the deeply concave surface. An analysis of this
figure is easily given. It is a cruciform arrangement of four portions of
rather elaborate double borders. Each part consists of two parallel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
bands, a principal and a subordinate, separated by parallel lines and
taking the relation to each other always noticed in the two belts of designs
painted upon the exterior of vases. Two of the sections are
alike. The others differ from these and from each other.</p>

</div>

<p>One figure, consisting of three linked volutes, is defined in white by
painting around it a black ground. The artist in painting this vessel
has probably not thought of achieving anything beyond the filling up
neatly of the four spaces, and has followed the usual practice of borrowing
his motives from other objects; yet it will not be wise to conclude
that these figures are really meaningless combinations of lines.
The persistency and individuality of certain motives makes it almost
certain that they are not the result of aimless elaboration, and that the
potter understood their significance. They are too purely geometric,
however, to furnish any clew to us through internal evidence. We
have no resource beyond the analogies of historic art. Modern tribes
use the current meander to symbolize water, and a leading motive in
many of these designs&mdash;the linked scroll running through a field of
serrate lines&mdash;is wonderfully like some forms of the Aztec symbol for
water, as may be seen by reference to the Mexican codices.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

</div>

<p>Another very excellent example of these bowls is presented in Fig.
292. It is small and shallow, measuring six and a half inches in diameter
and two and a half in depth. The material is somewhat soft and
chalky. The walls are thick and the surface is well finished. The
painted design is cruciform, like the preceding, but is much more simple
and satisfactory. It is interesting to note the changes rung upon the
few simple motives employed in these designs. Again apparently each
of the four parts is a fragment of a double border, cut up and fitted
into the concave surface. The bands with oblique, dotted, or stepped
lines, Fig. 293, are repetitions of the neck belt of a bottle-shaped vase
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
or basket, and the other bands with their chaste fret-work repeat a
section of the body zone.</p>

<p>Bowls and cups of the hemispherical model are very often supplied
with handles. Like other bowls, they are embellished with painted designs
derived from vases or from textile sources. In order of evolution,
they probably follow the plain form&mdash;the handles being added to facilitate
use.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 294</span>.&mdash;Bowl: Province of Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>The principal varieties of handles have already been described. The
bowl illustrated in Fig. 294 is furnished with a single semicircular loop.
In form, finish, and color it is the same as that of the other bowls, and
the painted design has a similar derivation and arrangement.</p>

<p>In the collection we have a fine large red bowl, now in a fragmentary
state. It is eleven inches in diameter and six inches deep. A small
loop is attached to the outside near the margin. It has a very decided
resemblance in color, finish, and ornamentation to the red bowls of the
Rio Virgen. The color of both the surface and the mass is a dull red.
A broad band of bright red paint encircles the exterior, leaving a plain
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
marginal band of the ground color and a plain area of the same upon
the bottom. The painted design, which covers the inner surface is
shown in Fig. 295. We discover in it at first sight a type to all appearances
totally distinct from the usual devices of this locality, but a closer
study reveals the existence of the favorite motive&mdash;the meander&mdash;doubled
up across the middle in a way to challenge detection, with the
ever-present auxiliary band above and below. The curiously complex
and very pleasing ornament is amplified in Fig. 296.</p>

<p>One small cup or bowl has two ears, not semicircular, but rectangular,
which are placed horizontally and project in sharp points at the
corners.</p>

<p>The neat little vessel given in Fig. 297 has a much elongated horizontal
loop, carelessly made and rudely attached. The bowl is handsomely
finished. The margin is ornamented with a series of closely
placed transverse lines or dots, a character appearing more frequently
in the northern ware. The interior design is made up of four independent
parts as usual.</p>

<p>The cup presented in Fig. 298 serves to illustrate another variety of
handle&mdash;a large vertical loop, extending from rim to base, like those on
the upright cups given in Figs. 287 and 288. The paste is very fine
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
grained, and breaks with a conchoidal fracture. The color is gray and
the paint reddish from the firing. The bottom is flat, a rare occurrence
in the more archaic, pottery. The painted design is based upon the
meander, and occupies nearly the entire exterior surface of the cup.
The handle has two bird-track shaped figures on its outer surface.</p>

<p>Vessels with long cylindrical handles are distributed over a very
extended district, but in Tusayan they are of a better class of ware than
elsewhere. Here the handles are long and stout and frequently terminate
in a loop, probably intended for the attachment of a cord. The
bowl is often graceful in form and tasteful in ornament. One of the
finer examples is illustrated in Fig. 299. It is of the chalky ware, and
has a very good surface finish. The handle is one inch in diameter
and five inches long. It is hollow and terminates in a narrow loop. It
is decorated with two groups of spirally inclined lines. The interior
decoration of the bowl furnishes a most excellent example of the crucifrm
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
designs previously described. This is well shown in Fig. 300.
The exterior surface is embellished with a most primitive drawing of a
bird, Fig. 301&mdash;a striking illustration of the pictorial accomplishments
of these classic decorators. Subjects of this class are of rare occurrence
upon the ancient white ware.</p>

<p>The dipper presented in Fig. 302 is somewhat inferior in workmanship
to the preceding example. The handle is plain and terminates in a horizontal
loop. The painted design is not arranged about a square, as in
the examples given, but leaves a space in the center of the bowl
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span>
resembling a four-cornered star. This shape is, however, the result of
accident. The four parts are units of an elaborate border, not severed
from their original connection, but contorted from crowding into the circular
space. The design drawn upon a plain surface is shown in Fig.
303. Projected in a straight line, as in Fig. 304, it is readily recognized
as the lower three-fourths of a zone of scroll ornamentation. A unit of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
the design drawn in black is shown in Fig. 305. The meander is developed
in the white color of the ground, and consists of two charmingly
varied threads running side by side through a field of black,
bordered by heavy black lines. The involute ends of the units are connected
by two minute auxiliary scrolls.</p>

<p>Bowls heretofore referred to as heart-shaped are of frequent occurrence
in the valley of the Little Colorado. A number have been obtained
by the Bureau of Ethnology directly from the Pueblo Indians,
while a few very superior specimens are in the collection of Mr. Keam.
A somewhat globular example is represented in Fig. 306.</p>

<p>It is remarkable in having four zones of devices. The narrow belt next
the lip contains a single line of bird-track figures. The others exhibit
simple forms of the meander. It is interesting to notice the variety
of treatment. In the upper band we have a chain of units imperfectly
connected. In the others there are series of triangular links quite
disconnected from each other. All are defined in white by painting in
a ground of black.</p>

<p>This district has furnished few vessels of more exquisite form and decoration
than that shown in Fig. 307. It is from the Keam collection.
The outlines are exceptionally symmetrical, and the design, developed
in the white of the ground, is drawn with more than usual care. The
figures are severely simple, however, and comprise but one motive&mdash;the
typical scroll, which is arranged in three zones, separated by parallel
lines. The spaces are filled in with serrate lines, parallel with the connecting
fillets or stems of the volutes, as in the case given in Fig. 290.</p>

<p>Another smaller vessel from the same collection is simple and unpretentious,
but so thoroughly satisfactory in every respect that one could
hardly suggest an improvement. The surface is well polished. The
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_331">331</a></span>
ground color is whitish, and the design&mdash;a chain of classic scrolls&mdash;is
produced in white by filling up the interstices with black. It is a noteworthy
fact that the base of this cup has been perforated, apparently for
use as a strainer. Nearly a hundred small round holes have been made
while the clay was still soft. A pottery ladle from this region, now in
the National collection, exhibits the same feature.</p>

margins of the figures are serrate and the volutes, which are in white,
have clumsy, disconnected stems.</p>

<p>The vessel presented in Fig. 310 has a flattened upper surface, an angular
shoulder, and a high body, slightly conical below. The painted
design is nearly obliterated in places by abrasion or weathering, but is
correctly presented in Fig. 311, which gives the three zones in horizontal
projection. This brings out a very marked feature, the cruciform
arrangement of the parts, which would not be apparent in a vertical
projection.

<p>The two inner circles occupy the upper surface of the vessel and the
outer one the most expanded portion of the body. The inner belt is
separated into four panels or compartments by as many series of transverse
lines, the panels being filled in with longitudinal, broken lines.
The second band is also divided by four series of straight lines, but the
compartments are occupied by scrolls in white, bordered by serrate
wings in black. The outer band exhibits a very curious combination
of features, the whole figure, however, being based upon the meander.
It is probable that the grouping in fours is accidental, the division of a
surface into four being much more readily accomplished than into any
other number above two.

<p>There are few better examples of the skill and good taste of the ancient
potter than the bowl illustrated in Fig. 312. The body is much
flattened and the incurved margin considerably depressed. The color
is reddish, both on the surface and in the mass, while the upper part is
painted a bright red. Upon this color, encircling the shoulder and
extending inward toward the lip, is a handsome design in black and
white lines. This is nearly obliterated, but enough is left to show that
it consists of a highly elaborated rectilinear meander pattern, the idea
being developed apparently in the light ground color. The painted
lines are in black bordered with fine white stripes&mdash;a common occurrence
in the south.</p>

<p>We have in the Museum an exquisitely shaped vessel of this class
obtained from the Zuñi Indians. The material and color are identical
with the red specimen from Saint George. The whole surface is painted
red and a neat border design in black is worked over this. The lip is
not so much depressed as in the preceding examples. Two perforations
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>
occur near the margin, through which the Zuñis have passed a buckskin
thong. Another plain bowl is very much compressed vertically.</p>

<p>Oblong bowls are not a prominent feature in Pueblo pottery. A few
examples were found at Saint George, Utah, but these are of the shallow
variety. The only oblong bowl with incurved rim yet sent in is
shown in Fig. 313. It is six inches long and four inches wide. The
ornamentation consists of three lines of meanders, that upon the flat
upper surface being irregular and not continuous.</p>

</div>

<p>In Fig. 314 we see another variation from the two usual forms of
bowls. This vessel is globular, and the aperture quite large. Two
small nodes attached to the sides and vertically perforated serve as
handles. The ornamentation consists of a number of disconnected and
greatly varied bands of meandered lines and figures, obliquely placed.
The ornamented surface is separated into two parts by vertical panels
at the handles. This affords a suggestion, of an adventitious or mechanical
origin for the vertical bands which are so prominent a feature
in modern Pueblo pottery. One of these is partially visible at the right
side in the cut.

<p><span class="smcap">Ollas.</span>&mdash;A typical example of the chalky ware of Tusayan is illustrated
in Fig. 315. It is a wide, low vase of symmetrical form. The
body is flattened above and hemispherical below. The material is almost
as white and as soft as chalk. The design comprises two zones of
devices. One occupies the upright neck, and consists of encircling lines
interrupted by vertical bands. The other, upon the flattened shoulder,
is based upon the meander. Both are bordered by wide bands in the
dark color and an additional band encircles the body.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">
<a href="images/335_dp562b.jpg" id="p335_f316" >

</div>

<p>Another handsome little vase is presented in Fig. 316. The two
meanders show very diverse styles of treatment. In the upper the
lines are all oblique, while in the lower they are chiefly rectangular and
much prolonged horizontally. Corresponding treatment of the two
bands occurs in other vessels.</p>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 317 is very different in appearance from the
two preceding, and is much larger and ruder in finish. The surface has
been finished with the trowel or hand without polishing. It is ten
inches high and the same in width. The whole decoration consists of
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
interlinked meander-units not arranged in belts, but thrown together
in a careless manner across the body of the vase. In the Keam collection
there is a water bottle nearly twice as large as this, similar
in shape and finish, but having a very different though equally rude
painted design. This collection contains also the large pot-like vessel
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
or cauldron shown in Fig. 318. The walls are heavy, the lip is rounded,
and the form is such as to be very serviceable for ordinary domestic use.
The ornamentation consists of two bands of figures, the upper, as
usual, being very simple. The figures of the body zone are in black upon
the light ground. Two sets, or pairs, of the triangular links make the
circuit of the vessel, the entire ornament appearing in Fig. 319.</p>

<p>There is, however, something less simple and consistent in the ornament
seen in Fig. 320. The connecting stems of the units are heavy dark
lines. The ends of the links are but imperfectly developed or are obscured
by elaboration giving a suggestion of degeneracy, but the whole
result is highly pleasing. The shape is an exceptional one, the body
being flattened to a greater degree than usual. The ground color and
the paste are quite white, yet there is in the design and its treatment a
suggestion of the decoration of the cream colored ware of Tusayan.
This suggestion is emphasized by the occurrence of the two pairs of
dark strokes on the neck&mdash;a feature more usual in the yellow wares.

<p>In 1883 Mr. Mindeleff brought in two superb examples of ancient
water vases. They are excellent illustrations of the skill and taste of
the ancient Pueblo potter. The example illustrated in Fig. 321 is ten
and a half inches in height and twelve inches in diameter. Its form
is symmetrical and graceful. The surface has been whitened, but is
somewhat uneven and not highly polished. The painted design is
well preserved, and consists of two broad belts of devices. The upper,
occupying the sloping neck, is a very simple combination of lines, based
upon a single white meandered line, and the lower is quite complex and
encircles the widest part of the body. The latter appears at first sight
to be rather complicated, but is easily resolved into its elements.

<p>The zone is five and a half inches in width and consists of two lines
of highly elaborated meanders combined in a most ingenious and pleasing
manner. The design is projected in Fig. 322 and compares favorably
with the exquisite diaper patterns of oriental decorators. A single
unit of its structure is given in Fig. 323. The triangular spaces along
the border are filled in with fragments of designs harmonious in style
with the principal figures. Certain spaces of the expanded connecting
fillets of the units, are filled in with serrate or dotted lines. Some portion
of the design seem to be developed in the white ground, as, for instance,
the figures in the lateral triangles.

<p>The boldness of the primitive decorator is well shown in the manipulation
of these large vases. Simplicity and breadth were not sacrificed
when it became necessary to carry the oft-repeated figures over the
broad surface of such a vessel as that shown in Fig. 324, whose height
and width measure fourteen inches each. In shape, in surface treatment,
and in the arrangement of the broad belts of decoration this
vessel corresponds very closely with the preceding, but the favorite
motives are executed in the white color of the ground, and are thrown
across the surface of the vessel with charming freedom and boldness.
The upper zone encircling the neck is occupied by a large, rather
rudely drawn chain of scrolls developed in the white ground by painting
the interspaces black. The broad belt of figures encircling the body
of the vase is not filled out as in the preceding case, the lower series
of triangular spaces being plain. The principal feature consists of a single
line of the fret-work developed in the white ground. This is shown
in Fig. 325. A unit of the design is given in black in Fig. 326. The
connecting curve or stem of the unit incloses a rectangular space, through
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
which the fillet returns in a series of fine scrolls. The interlocked ends
of the units of the principal chain have terminations or hooks angular
in two cases and curved in another, demonstrating the identity of the
curvilinear and the rectilinear forms of this ornament. The small isolated
stepped figure between the hooks tells, I imagine, of a textile
ancestry.</p>

</div>

<p>In Fig. 327 we have another vase of still higher grade&mdash;a very masterpiece
of fictile work. It is next to the largest piece of the ancient ware
yet described, being twenty-four inches in diameter and upward of twenty
inches in height. The form is not quite symmetrical, but the outline
is highly satisfactory. The body is full and slightly conical at the
base, and above joins the neck with a graceful convex curve. The surface
is even and well polished, and the painted design is executed with
great precision. The motives employed are identical with the preceding.
Scrolls and fretted figures are carried around the neck, shoulder,
and body in three bands suited exactly in width and in size of parts to
the conformation of the vessel. The simple scrolls of the upper part
need no explanation, and a careful analysis of the broader band, as
projected in Fig. 328, furnishes a key to its rather extraordinary construction.
The dark lines are drawn with mechanical exactness, and
the delicate white lines, in which many of the finer details are worked
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342">342</a></span>
out, are <i>left</i> with a nicety of handling worthy of the most skilled decorator.
By a reference to the outline given in Fig. 329 it will be seen that
the whole ornament hangs upon a single thread woven into a chain of
delicate fret-work running through the middle of the design. The long
connecting band of each unit consists of two lines (taking the black
lines as representative of the idea or motive), which separate in the
middle part, inclosing a wide rectangular space. This is filled with geometric
ornamentation in white lines upon a black ground, as shown in
Fig. 328. The triangular spaces above are occupied by checker-work
of light and heavy lines. The very marked rectangular character of
this handsome design indicates familiarity with the textile embodiment
of the motive.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bottles.</span>&mdash;Under this head I desire to present a number of vases
having high, narrow necks. Few examples of the pottery of any people
show bolder and more successful treatment than the specimen illustrated
in Fig. 330. It is a large, full-bodied bottle, the neck and lip of
which unfortunately are lost. The restored outline can profess to be approximate
only. The surface is well polished, though gray from age.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
Two masterly scrolls, formed each of a broad black line bordered by
white lines, are thrown across opposite sides of the vase. The ground
upon which they are drawn is filled in with series of lines which accommodate
themselves very gracefully to the surface of the vessel and to
the scrolls.</p>

<p>A number of ancient vessels, found in the hands of the Zuñi Indians,
were probably obtained by them from some of the neighboring ruins,
although in a few cases they may have been carried from distant places
in the north or west. The finer examples correspond very closely to
the ware of which multitudes of fragments are found at old Zuñi,
San Antonio Springs, Nutria, and other places in or near the province
of Cibola. They seem to be identical also in many respects with the
better class of the white ware of Tusayan. The forms are very much
the same and the ornaments exhibit similar arrangements of identical
motives.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 332</span>.&mdash;Vase: Province of Cibola.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>The superb vessel illustrated in Fig. 331, is a typical example of
the work of the ancient potters of Cibola. In form it falls but little
short of perfect symmetry. The body is nearly globular, being slightly
compressed vertically. The neck is small and the lip slightly recurved.
The surface, originally white, now darkened from use, is well polished
excepting where roughened by age. In Fig. 333 we have a partial projection
of the painted design obtained by viewing the vase vertically.
This may be described as a rosette of spiral rays which consist of gracefully
meandered lines alternating with groups of plain stripes. These
are developed in the light color of the vase by painting in a black ground.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>
Viewed from the side the decoration is seen to consist of the two usual
zones&mdash;a narrow one about the neck, occupied by a meander, and a
broad one covering the greater part of the body, crossed obliquely by a
number of bands of ornament.</p>

<p>A similar vase, also from Zuñi, is illustrated in Fig. 332. It is much
darkened by use and age and has suffered considerably from wear and
tear. The ornament consists of three zones, a band of stepped figures
about the neck, a handsome meander-chain with terraced links upon
the rounded collar, and a broad belt of radiating meanders encircling
the body. A vertical view showing the two outer lines of decoration is
given in Fig. 334. A peculiar feature in this vessel is the indented finger-hold
seen in the lower part of the body, Fig. 332.</p>

<p>In both form and ornament these bottles exhibit decided resemblances
to wicker vessels. The introduction of stepped figures and spiral rays
sufficiently demonstrates the textile origin of the painted designs.</p>

<p>A few bottles are larger than the examples given. One having a
high narrow neck is seventeen inches high and sixteen in diameter
of body. Generally vases of this shape are below medium size, and
they are very often supplied with handles or perforated knobs, either
upon the shoulder or the neck. In a few cases only the necks are high
and slender like the bottles of the mound-builders of the middle Mississippi
region.</p>

<p>The vessel illustrated in Fig. 335 is not properly classified either with
the preceding or with the following group, but I place it here on account
of its peculiar painted device, which appears in other forms and connections
in the two succeeding figures. The ornament as usual occupies
two zones, each of which has three groups of vertical lines alternating
with as many star-like figures resembling somewhat the Maltese cross.
The latter device may possibly have been introduced to represent some
idea, and I have no doubt that almost any member of the modern tribes
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
could be induced to give a full explanation of its significance. It would,
however, be his idea only and not necessarily that of the ancient potter.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Handled vessels.</span>&mdash;Handled vessels of this province are greatly varied.
Examples of the dippers have already been given. Besides them
there is a long series of vessels with more or less constricted necks; the
handles of which are of three or four pretty distinct varieties, including
the long vertical loop connecting the rim with the shoulder or body, the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_347">347</a></span>
strong horizontal loop set at the base of the neck, and the perforated
knob placed upon the shoulder. There are also a few examples of cup-shaped
projections, Fig. 351, and heads of animals, Fig. 352, which are
set upon the neck near the rim and seem to be survivals of handles or
ornaments merely.</p>

</div>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 336 has an interesting combination of decorative
features. I present it here, although a little out of place in my
classification by form, in order to point out the similarity between its
decoration and that of Fig. 335. It is a handsome mug of hard gray
ware, finished with a white slip, and decorated with painted designs in
the prevailing arrangement. Four equidistant nodes of large size are
placed about the shoulder of the vessel. These occur along the middle
of the lower zone of painted devices, the notable feature being that the
volutes of the painted scroll-work encircle the nodes and inclose, between
their interlinked points, cross-like devices, resembling those found upon
the preceding specimen. These crosses occupy the apices of the nodes,
as shown in the illustration. The painted design is given in Fig. 337.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
The design proper&mdash;the interlinked scrolls&mdash;is in white, the dark color
being used as a ground to develop it. This is true of a great majority
of the examples presented. The same device, with a slightly different
combination, is seen in Fig. 338, which illustrates a small jug from the
Keam collection. The design is well shown in Fig. 339, and in this case
it will readily be seen that the motive proper is in white, while the black
hooks and the connecting lozenge-shaped figures, forming the cross,
represent the ground. This association of the cross with the linking of
the scrolls is suggestive of a possible origin of the device as used independently
in the instance given in Fig. 335.</p>

meander motives.

<p>The vessel illustrated in Fig. 340 belongs to the Keam collection. The
decoration is very simple and consists of a novel combination of running
scrolls. The design is produced by filling in the space between
two separate chains of scrolls in black with fine oblique lines, Fig. 341.
Identical treatment of the meander is found upon a mug brought from
Zuñi and illustrated by Mr. Stevenson in the Second Annual Report of
the Bureau of Ethnology. Fig. 342. This will be apparent when the
design, Fig. 343, is placed by the side of the preceding. The first is
drawn in curved black lines, the ground remaining white, the second
is in rectilinear white lines, the ground being black.</p>

<p>Two others of like character, one angular and the other curvilinear,
are found upon small red vessels from Tusayan, Figs. 344 and 345. Still
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
another noteworthy example is found upon the interior surface of a red
bowl from Cibola, which, when projected in a straight line, gives the
handsome ornament illustrated in Fig. 346.</p>

<p>There is in the Keam collection a very interesting vessel, having two
heavy horizontal loops attached to opposite sides of the body. The
painted figure consists chiefly of a rectangular meander in white bordered
by black and forming a wide zone about the body of the vessel.
The spaces are filled in with fine parallel oblique lines. With the addition
of a foot this vessel would be found to resemble, in both form and
ornament, some early varieties of the Greek kylix.</p>

</div>

<p>The wide-mouthed vase shown in Fig. 348 differs very decidedly in
style from the last. It is finer in texture and much more carefully finished.
The form is decidedly antique. The painted design is quite
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
indistinct, the color having rubbed off or faded out. The work has been
neatly done with a fine brush and exhibits some new features in point
of detail. If we trace out the figures, however, we will see that there
are no new motives, the meander forming the basis of all. There is a
double line of figures, the upper one being the more simple, as usual.</p>

<p>In the bottle illustrated in Fig. 349 the usual motives have been employed.
A few heavy lines serve to give emphasis to the lip, while a
band of linked scrolls is carried around the shoulder, bordered by simple
parallel lines. Unpretentious as the work is, it has a very pleasing
effect. The shape is repeated in modern Pueblo pottery. It is the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
original of the canteen, which has acquired the flattened form through
accident, or change in the habits of the people employing it. A very
superior example of these bottles is given in Fig. 350. The body is
somewhat flattened and the sides are nearly perpendicular, giving two
well defined spaces for decoration, the one above and the other about
the middle of the body. The latter space is occupied by a very slender,
meandered line in white, the interspaces being filled in with black.
Four links encircle the vessel, two oblong ones occurring upon the sides
and two short ones beneath the handles. The upper surface is decorated
with a band of scrolls, four in number, partially defined in white
by painting the space on one side black. There are two low, knob-like,
vertically perforated handles on the shoulder of the vessel.</p>

<p>The vessel shown in Fig. 351 is interesting on account of the peculiar
knobs or ears placed on the sides of the neck, near the lip. They rudely
resemble the corolla of a flower, but suggest as well the wheel-like coils
of hair gathered up at the sides of the head by the women of Moki.
They were probably associated with some superstition of the ancients.
The neck of the bottle is unusually high. The shape is quite graceful
and the painted decoration is simple and effective.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 352</span>.&mdash;Vase: Eastern Arizona.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>In a collection recently sent from the vicinity of Springerville, Arizona,
by E. W. Nelson, there are a number of vessels similar in appearance to
the preceding, but with shorter necks and rounder bodies. They are
small, well-finished, and in some cases quite new looking. The designs
in black are nicely executed and exhibit considerable refinement of taste.
One having a small animal head attached to the side of the neck is illustrated
in Fig. 352. A broad meandered border encircles the neck, and
a superb pattern, consisting of four ingeniously combined horizontal
chains of meanders in white covers the upper three fourths of the body.</p>

<p><i>Eccentric and life forms.</i>&mdash;In the collection made by Mr. Nelson there
are several eccentric forms. One, a two-storied vessel of good proportion,
neat finish and ornamentation, is illustrated in Fig. 353. The form
is an exceptional one in the ancient ware, but is frequently seen in modern
work of the Pueblos and other tribes. It had its origin perhaps in
a double-lobed form of the gourd, or possibly the idea was suggested
by the superposition of one vessel upon another.</p>

<p>As previously observed, the Pueblo ware is characterized, in a general
way, by great simplicity of form. There is, however, one small group
of eccentric forms within which we find a pretty wide range of outline,
a few specimens exhibiting undoubted resemblances to life forms. Nearly
all are bottles with handles and lobed bodies, often unsymmetrical.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
The handle in each case connects the lip with the shoulder or body of the
vessel. The lobes are generally three in number and are rarely of equal
dimensions, one being more or less prolonged.</p>

<div class="figcenter w50">
<a href="images/354_dp581a.jpg" id="p354_f353">

</div>

<p>It is very difficult to say where these curious forms originated, or in
what direction they were developing. Did the archaic potter, by exaggerating
the accidental eccentricities of early and simple forms, arrive
at these grotesque shapes, did use determine their conformation, or must
we look for their originals in antecedent utensils derived from, or made
in direct imitation of, life forms?</p>

</div>

<p>It is manifestly useless to seek for their antecedents within the limits
of the ceramic art. A few are of such a shape as to suggest the skin
vessels so often used by primitive peoples, and their origin in this
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
manner would be entirely consistent with the laws of art growth. One
variety is shaped somewhat like a shoe or moccasin. Another takes
the form of a bird. In regard to their origin it would indeed be
a marvel if they should be found to represent an intermediate step between
the skin vessels of primitive peoples and the conventional pitcher
of civilization, as corresponding shapes are thought to do in Eastern
countries.</p>

<p>Within the Pueblo province these vessels are widely but not very
generally distributed, so far as specimens at hand show. I have already
described two examples, Figs. 255 and 256, from Saint George, Utah,
which are of the simplest type, having three nodes with no suggestion
of life form.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 356</span>.&mdash;Vase of eccentric form: Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>In Fig. 354 we have a small, well-finished cup of white ware, from
Tusayan, similar in outline to the Saint George specimens. One of the
three somewhat pointed nodes is considerably more prominent than the
others. The handle is unique, being modeled apparently after the
curved neck of a gourd, the pointed tip touching but not uniting with
the body of the vessel. This vessel is handsomely decorated with two
bands of scrolls. That upon the neck is of a usual form consisting
of three sets of linked scrolls with zigzag or stepped connecting fillets.
The scrolls of the lower bands interlock upon the three nodes and are
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
connected by broad Z-shaped stems also stepped or notched. This specimen
is from the Keam collection.</p>

<p>Another smaller vessel, still more unique in character, is illustrated in
Fig. 355. One of the nodes is very much prolonged, giving, with the
upright neck, a form rudely suggestive of a bird. The ornament, like
the last, consists of two bands. The upper is of diamond-shaped figures
in white upon a black ground, and the lower of a cleverly managed
meander, which is made to conform neatly to the eccentricities of the
body. The hooks encircle the nodes as in the preceding case.</p>

<p>A smaller specimen is given in Fig. 356. The node next the handle
being prolonged resembles the tail of a bird, while the other nodes,
which would occupy the place of the two prominences of the breast, are
barely suggested. The decoration is extremely simple.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 357</span>.&mdash;Vase of eccentric form: Tusayan.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>A fine specimen of these novel vessels is illustrated in Fig. 357. The
body is much prolonged on one side and has no prominence whatever
at the breast points. The handle is but slightly arched and connects
the rim with the extreme point of the projecting lobe. There is here a
rather decided suggestion of a skin or intestine vessel. It is but a
step from this form to the well-known shoe or moccasin shape of a later
period of Pueblo art, a form known in nearly all centers of ancient
American culture. The decoration is simple and unique, consisting of
a meandered figure in white upon a black ground, with parallel bordering
lines in black. It connects opposite sides of the rim passing beneath
the projecting lobe.</p>

<p>A number of the best examples are in the National collection. One
of these, Fig. 358, is figured by Mr. Stevenson in the Third Annual Report
of the Bureau of Ethnology. It might be described as shoe-shaped,
yet we are forcibly reminded of the headless body of a bird, the rather
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
square projecting breast being a marked feature. The painted ornament
consists of broad zigzag, meandered bands filled in with fine oblique
stripes.</p>

<div class="figcenter w75">

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Fig. 358</span>.&mdash;Vase of eccentric form: Cibola.&mdash;<sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub>.</p>
</div>

<p>One of the finest specimens is presented in Fig. 359. The triangular
or three-lobed form of body is still noticeable, two of the points forming
the breast, and the other, much prolonged, standing for the tail of the
bird. The meaning of the latter feature is made plain by the painted
figure. A conventional design, consisting of concentric, plain and
zigzag lines, occupies the back, and terminates behind in a row of pinnate
marks, evidently a conventional drawing of the tail. The wings
are indicated at the sides by a design like that upon the back. The
breast is embellished with a series of oblong dots probably intended for
feathers. In this case the neck, which is high and narrow, has three
prominences near the top; one at the front represents the bill of the
bird, and others at the sides are meant for eyes. A handle has connected
the head with the middle of the back. This is nearly all broken
away and the stumps have been perforated for the insertion of cords.
A serrate collar in black encircles the neck. The original of this vase
was obtained in the Pueblo country and belongs to Dr. Sheldon Jackson.
A specimen recently acquired by the National Museum is superior
to this in its decorative treatment. The body has four lobes, one
for the breast, another for the tail, and one for each of the wings.
Each of these lobes is made the center about which the volutes of the
very elaborate scroll-work are turned.</p>

<p>I shall give one more illustration, Fig. 360. This is taken from the
Keam collection and represents a bird. The vessel is quite distinct in
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
shape from those previously given, being much like the bird vessels of
the mound-builders. It is a cup with constricted rim, the head, tail,
and wings of the bird projecting horizontally from the outer margin of
the rim. It is of the white ware and has had a painted design in black
lines, now nearly obliterated.</p>

<h3>CONCLUDING REMARKS.</h3>

<p>Two great groups of ceramic products have now been presented&mdash;the
coiled ware and the white decorated ware. These groups belong to the
first great period of pueblo art in clay. Their chronological identity is
sometimes questioned, the coiled ware to all appearances being the more
archaic. It is simple in form and rude in finish, is without painted ornament,
and was relegated to the more ordinary uses. These and other
features give countenance to the theory of greater antiquity; but the
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
intimate association of the two groups in nearly every locality indicates
close identity in time. It cannot be said that the other classes of ware
found within the same province belong to different times or to distinct
races, but they are widely separated in many important characters from
the two leading groups. They exhibit greater variety of form, less
constraint in decoration, and greatly improved technique, points tending
to prove advance in culture, and, presumably, in time.</p>

<p>The more closely the ceramic art of the ancient peoples is studied the
more decidedly it appears that it was profoundly influenced by the textile
arts, and especially by basketry. The latter art was practiced from
remote antiquity, and within historic times the manufacture of baskets
has been the most important industry of the tribes of the Pacific slope
of temperate North America. Ceramic shapes, wherever found within
this region, coincide closely with textile outlines, and the geometric
ornamentation can be traced to textile prototypes originating in the
technical peculiarities of construction.</p>

<p>Another point brought out by the preceding studies follows naturally
the foregoing statement. There are in the pueblo country no primitive
forms of earthenware. This may lead to the inference that the pueblo
tribes migrated from other regions in which the earlier stages of the art
had existed, but taken in connection with the lack of individuality in
the potter's art, and its evident dependence upon the textile art, it
leads decidedly to the conclusion that art in clay was acquired by these
tribes in comparatively recent times. The ancient pueblos practised
the art of basketry, but clearly remained ignorant of the plastic art,
until by some accident of environment it was introduced or discovered.
Under the influence of the sister art, pottery at once took a high
stand. During the first stages, however, it was a servile art, reproducing
the forms and decorations of basketry. The true plastic characters
of clay remained practically undiscovered, and is only now, under
the influence of the European, dawning upon the conservative mind of
the inhabitant of the plateaus.</p>

<p>Besides basketry, it is probable that the early pueblos made use of
gourds and of tissue vessels, traces of their influence occurring quite
frequently, but there is no indication whatever of the presence of carvings
in shell, wood, and stone.</p>

<p>I do not wish in this place to dwell upon the details of pueblo ornament.
A single example will serve to illustrate the origin and character
of the leading decorative conceptions. Glancing through the
series of vases illustrated under painted ware, we find that ninety-four
out of one hundred designs are meanders, or are based upon the
meander. Beginning with the simple waved or broken line we pass up
through all grades of increasing complexity to chains of curvilinear and
rectilinear meanders in which the links are highly individualized, being
composed of a sigmoid line, terminating in reversed hooks; but in no
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
case do we reach a loop in the curved forms or an intersection in the
angular forms. The typical intersecting Greek fret does not therefore
occur, nor, I may add, is it found anywhere in native American art.</p>

<p>The constructional characters of the art in which these linear forms
developed, although they encouraged geometrical elaboration, forbade
intersections or crossings of a line upon itself, and the genius of the
decorator had never freed itself from this bondage. The forms imposed
upon decoration by the textile art are <i>necessarily</i> geometric and
rectilinear, and their employment in other and less conventional arts,
has been too limited to destroy or even greatly modify these characters.</p>

<p>The study of Pueblo art embodied in the preceding pages tells the
simple story of the evolution of art&mdash;and especially of decorative art&mdash;in
a period when the expanding mind of primitive man, still held in the
firm grasp of instinctive and traditional methods&mdash;the bonds of nature&mdash;was
steadily working out its æsthetic destiny.</p>
